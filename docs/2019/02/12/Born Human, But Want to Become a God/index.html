<h3 id="Born-Human"><a href="#Born-Human" class="headerlink" title="Born Human"></a>Born Human</h3><p>Opening various new social apps, with anonymous chatting, plot reasoning, role-playing—there are many kinds. If you get involved, you can find some fun. However, most of the users of these apps are from the 2000s generation. It reminds me of the days when the 90s generation hadn’t grown up, when Feixin was still alive. There were various WAP websites, information, forums, self-service, text page games, and communities filled with so-called family groups. Everyone was keen on discussing online browsers and free data methods. That era has passed.</p>
<p>Admiring the dog’s acting in “Hachi: A Dog’s Tale” and “A Dog’s Purpose,” which takes a different approach, telling its life’s story from the dog’s perspective. Someone mentioned that the dog’s four lives in the film correspond to the four stages of human life. Initially, naive and carefree; then entering work, life becomes dull, as if losing something, feeling empty; then silent companionship, life becomes plain, surrounded by family and friends; finally, life reaches a desperate stage, becoming hopeless, returning to the original, starting to search for the beginning…</p>
<p>“Lolita” is a film about a forbidden love between a young girl and an older man. The man rents an apartment, where only a single mother and daughter live. The man falls in love with the underage daughter, while the mother falls in love with the man. The mother, being the landlord, threatens the man to either marry her or leave the apartment. To see the daughter again, the man marries the mother. In name, the man becomes the daughter’s father. However, the man and the daughter have all kinds of indescribable relationships…</p>
<p>With limited cultivation, I did not see any profound meaning in this year’s New Year’s film “Crazy Alien.” It was meant to be an absurd comedy. But during the viewing, I was surprised that the two main characters did not turn the alien’s abilities into their own gain. They knew the headband had power but never thought of possessing that power. Maybe I am too selfish, only thinking about myself. But from the ending, after a series of ups and downs, the alien left, flying away in a spaceship, taking a warehouse full of liquor. And then? The liquor seller continues to sell liquor, the monkey trainer continues to train monkeys, and life goes on.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Become-a-God"><a href="#Why-Become-a-God" class="headerlink" title="Why Become a God"></a>Why Become a God</h3><p>Wang Yin is a programmer I admire. Recently, he mentioned in his blog that he is trying to make some changes. Instead of being called “God Yin,” he now prefers to be called “Old Wang.” I am very fortunate to learn about such a thoughtful technical expert through the internet.</p>
<p>A cousin has been living and working in Beijing for many years and recently plans to return to his hometown for development. In the eyes of relatives and friends, he is considered one of those who have done well. He has long been married, and his daughter is very cute. From several interactions, he seems to have high emotional intelligence. Being in sales, he is good at socializing, but lacks some professional skills. Because of his significant responsibilities, he does not appear very generous in small matters. “What are the endings for Beijing drifters?” Maybe there is an upper limit, but no lower limit.</p>
<p>A cousin married to a second-tier city. The first time I visited their home, it was in a rather remote old-style building without an elevator. Her family rents a house in an 18th-tier county. Maybe it’s cheap, but not as good as the house I currently rent…</p>
<p>Ordinary people remain ordinary. It is because we can see the future that we fear it. Knowing that efforts cannot change much, but still needing to strive.</p>
<p>Perhaps years later, I can tell someone all my experiences, the good and the bad, what I hoped for, what I despaired of, what I hated about my life, and what I loved about my life.</p>
<h3 id="If-You-Bloom"><a href="#If-You-Bloom" class="headerlink" title="If You Bloom"></a>If You Bloom</h3><p>Why am I no longer superstitious about technology? Because I discovered that technology cannot make a “complete” person.</p>
<p>Focus on life, learn to live, because being alive is life itself. It can be wonderful, it can fail.</p>
<p>Recently, the phrase “self-redemption” flashed in my mind. Life may have surprises, but there will be no miracles. What is sad is that surprises are often man-made.</p>
<p>Some emotions from long ago have now been mostly forgotten…</p>
