<p>On the road of life, some things can be changed, while others are restricted by the environment in which we grow up. We have faced many choices, some made by our elders, some by our own will. If we had made different choices at those times, how would our lives have changed?</p>
<p>“Goodbye Mr. Loser” is a story about “living again”, and “My Own Swordsman” also has an episode that depicts scenarios where everyone fulfills their own fantasies and “lives again”. In these two works, the endings of the “living again” segments are similar, suggesting that after experiencing various things, the present situation is still preferable. It’s unclear whether such endings are realistic or if both authors coincidentally compromised with life, acknowledging that changes are impossible, so they might as well accept it and live freely.</p>
<p>Reflecting on what I have done in the past, under the best choices, I can see what I could have achieved and know how much time I have wasted. By organizing what I am doing now and considering the highest degree of completion, I can understand how to strive for my future time.</p>
<p>Like a single-player RPG game, each level up brings new skill points, but the skill tree has numerous nodes, and even at the maximum level, you can only reach the end of a particular branch. We must choose a branch at low levels without understanding the game, and when the branch reaches its end, we know which skills are fun. Unfortunately, this happens only once because the game has already been played.</p>
<p>Returning to school after (only) two months, I felt as if everything had changed, yet remained the same. Regretfully, there are indeed regrets.</p>
