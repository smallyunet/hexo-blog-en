I couldn’t directly find the answer to this question on Baidu, and there isn’t a book in the library that discusses the relationship between advanced mathematics and communication engineering.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met a senior student who is currently in his fourth year. He mentioned that his grades are quite poor now and he regrets not learning advanced mathematics well. Facts speak louder than words, and the importance of advanced mathematics is evident.</p>
<p>Currently, for us, the importance of mathematics has two aspects: course learning and skill development.</p>
<h3 id="In-Course-Learning"><a href="#In-Course-Learning" class="headerlink" title="In Course Learning"></a>In Course Learning</h3><p>As long as it’s a course arranged by the school, there is no course that is unimportant.
Many schools offer advanced mathematics as a public basic course. I believe the educators have valid reasons for doing so, and the methods agreed upon by most people tend to be more accurate.
Advanced mathematics carries 5 credits, which makes the grade very important for us students. To get good grades, we must study well. If we fail to earn credits in advanced mathematics, the impact is significant. Furthermore, in graduate school entrance exams, advanced mathematics accounts for about 60% of the mathematics section, making its importance clear.</p>
<h3 id="In-Skill-Development"><a href="#In-Skill-Development" class="headerlink" title="In Skill Development"></a>In Skill Development</h3><p>Firstly, the communication engineering major requires learning the C language, and for programming, mathematics is crucial.
In a book titled “C++ From Beginner to Proficient,” the preface states: “Programs are mainly used to perform calculations.” This is evident from the tutorials in the book, which start by classifying data types, introducing various operators, and performing logical calculations. Of course, an important part of the content is the use of functions.
Not only in C language, but also in other programming languages such as PHP, JS, etc., the concept of “functions” is widely used. Although functions in programs are not only for numerical calculations, the principles of independent and dependent variable relationships remain constant.
In mathematical operations, precision is important. Writing a mathematical symbol incorrectly can lead to wrong results, and in programming, a single character error can cause the program to run incorrectly. Mathematics plays a role in developing our skills, aligning with professional qualities.</p>
<p>Since I am not very familiar with the communication engineering major, I only know from a class after school that it is related to analog electronics, digital electronics, microcontrollers, DSP, and so on.</p>
<p>If it’s related to electronics, it inevitably involves trigonometric functions and their peak value calculations.</p>
<p>I accidentally came across a book called “Principles and Design of Ultrasonic Motors,” which I could hardly understand, and I don’t know if it’s related to our major. The first part uses time integration to calculate equivalent capacitance.
Additionally, in books like “Principles of Communication,” especially in the signal section, many function relationships with integral symbols are used, showing the extensive application of differentiation and integration.</p>
<p>I believe that after we delve deeper into learning mathematics and professional knowledge, understanding what problems may arise in the major and how advanced mathematics can be used to solve these problems, we will gain more insights.</p>
