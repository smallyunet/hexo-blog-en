<p>The hero woke up in the twilight cave<br>Feeling confused about the life in his dream<br>Clearly it was peaceful and harmonious happiness<br>Yet it made one feel filled with despair<br>How much colorful prayer has been buried<br>By the monotonous and boring routine<br>In front of him were tall trees and rugged roads<br>Unrecognizable directions, unspeakable bitterness<br>The sun rises and sets, over and over<br>Endlessly, always the same lost path<br>Someone asked, what is loneliness?<br>He said, as soon as the bell rings, you know who the letter is from<br>Only her  </p>
<p>He returned to the place without dreams<br>But suddenly couldn’t tell where the dream was  </p>
<p>At that time<br>He met a passing priest, things started from there<br>He threw away his old magic book to seek more treasures<br>He began to think the journey might not be a solo one<br>The dangers and torments he faced before were his own trials<br>With the priest’s healing and blessings, everything became easier  </p>
<p>However<br>There are no unexpected surprises in the world<br>Maybe it’s not just a game<br>But ultimately, it’s just a passerby<br>The mutual support in the short time together<br>Is enough to piece together future memories<br>When time flows to a point where it can’t stop<br>He can still write an unmonotonous history  </p>
<p>Therefore<br>Many times he wanted to give up<br>But whenever he turned to leave<br>He saw her expression<br>It’s the feeling he couldn’t let go  </p>
<p>This is a game that can’t be broken<br>Once trapped in it, you lose completely  </p>
<p>At this moment<br>The town is not peaceful inside and out<br>The distant country is ravaged by war<br>The residents within the walls are like puppets<br>The walking dead can still unite against the enemy<br>Better than the wine sacks and rice bags trapped in their own cocoons<br>Demons from hell hold up signs<br>Randomly altering the imagined kingdom<br>Destroying the established order and mindset  </p>
<p>He couldn’t change anything<br>He wasn’t the only hero<br>Nor the only failure<br>No extraordinary talent<br>No divine prophecy from the heavens<br>Just an unsurprising play  </p>
<p>The play is still on<br>The stage hasn’t scattered<br>The audience is still watching  </p>
