<p>The murder mystery games are not as lively as before<br>Weekday players are not as immersed as before<br>The game proceeds as usual countless times<br>New stories, new scripts, new stores<br>But in my mind, only past scenes come to mind  </p>
<p>Open-source projects remain stagnant as usual<br>Nothing specifically needs to be done during the Spring Festival<br>I always want to avoid wasting time and life<br>But self-improvement has become a part of daily life  </p>
<p>Playing games that I’m not interested in to kill time<br>But I worry if time can really be used for leisure<br>However, if I don’t consume time, what else can I do  </p>
<p>Some people start families at a young age<br>Some are still single even at an older age<br>At the same age, some are forced to grow up<br>At the same age, some don’t want to take responsibility  </p>
<p>The vehicles on the street are not as bustling as before<br>On New Year’s Eve, I especially don’t want to go out<br>I want to experience the troubles alone<br>Mainly because there’s nothing to do outside  </p>
<p>The roommate reminds me to lock the doors and windows<br>But the kindness from hometown catches me off guard<br>Under the prosperity and beauty of this great era<br>How many struggling cattle and horses are concealed  </p>
<p>The scenery outside the window has been seen many times<br>The wind and clouds change<br>Constant and unchanging  </p>
<p>Maybe my writing skills have declined<br>Recently, there have indeed been many things without a clue<br>Too many things are unclear about the outcome<br>But at least I will always be here</p>
