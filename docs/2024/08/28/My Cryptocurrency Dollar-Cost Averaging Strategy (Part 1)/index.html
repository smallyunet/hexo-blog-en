<p>Over time and with a deeper understanding of the market, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategies, especially investment portfolios, can undergo significant changes. That’s why I’ve marked the title with (Part 1). If there are any changes in the DCA strategy, there might be a (Part 2), (Part 3), etc. I will also explain the reasons for any changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year, I’ve started to focus more on investment topics, and I have lost some money due to reckless operations.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been influenced by Xiaolai Li’s ideas. The theory behind the DCA strategy is quite exciting. You can delve deeper into it through the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ri.firesbox.com/#/">“Dollar-Cost Averaging Changes Your Life”</a> — Xiaolai Li, all content about DCA is in this book.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/tmRQImBk6NA?si=Cl7Fwiq2WcfM28P2">Dollar-Cost Averaging Changes Your Life: Live Online Course</a> — YouTube video, Xiaolai Li’s own interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from DCA, here are a few other investment-related references:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xiaolai/the-self-cultivation-of-leeks">“The Self-Cultivation of Leeks”</a> — Xiaolai Li</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChandlerGuoChannel">Chandler Guo’s YouTube Channel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I want to practice DCA as an investment method, and there are a few questions involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I join Xiaolai Li’s investment practice group? Not necessary, especially for those with self-control.</li>
<li>Should I buy <a href="https://b.watch/">BOX</a>? Rumor has it that you must read Li’s books and listen to the lessons, but never buy the coin.</li>
<li>How to implement DCA? Binance’s built-in DCA function is sufficient with zero fees (remember to occasionally transfer to a wallet).</li>
<li>What is the frequency of DCA? Daily, because the price changes so quickly that if the frequency is too low, the cycle becomes too long.</li>
<li>What is the duration of the DCA period? Currently, I’ve planned to use one year’s worth of funds for DCA.</li>
<li>What are the DCA targets?</li>
</ol>
<p>The assets and their allocation ratios I currently choose are:</p>

<p>Initially, Xiaolai Li’s BOX gave a high percentage to EOS, but it turned out that EOS failed, so now EOS is no longer part of the BOX components. The latest situation is that BTC accounts for 92% of BOX. Moreover, BOX has always included XIN, showing that everyone is subject to bias. Most of us probably don’t know what XIN is, but Li Xiaolai has consistently chosen this coin over the years.</p>
<p>In my DCA portfolio, BTC is undoubtedly in the lead, accounting for 50% of the portfolio. In addition, the five PoW coins account for a total of 20%. All PoW coins have a supply cap.</p>
<p>Due to the saying “Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver,” LTC has always been relatively strong. DOGE and LTC are like brothers in arms, using the same mining algorithm; <a href="https://www.litecoinpool.org/">mining pools</a> often mine both coins simultaneously. Therefore, the prices of LTC and DOGE can’t be simply estimated like BTC’s “shutdown price for miners.” Moreover, DOGE, as a memecoin leader, has a long history and is liked by Elon Musk, so it’s hard to let go. That’s why LTC and DOGE must be included together.</p>
<p>BCH was a workaround solution during the era of high BTC transaction fees (2017). Has the Blocksize War really ended? BCH represents the big block solution, so it should be included. BTC has moved away from the purpose of “electronic cash” and has become a “store of value.” I believe this debate is far from over. Later, BCH forked into BSV. Why not include BSV? The BSV ecosystem is small, and some projects within it are active but ignorant (like Note). The founder of BSV is still wanted by the court, among other reasons.</p>
<p>DASH and XEC are the most arbitrary choices, so obscure that many people haven’t heard of them, and they are also the highest-risk assets. XEC is chosen because the BCH <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node">node</a> code is forked from XEC’s code, suggesting that XEC has good technical capabilities. DASH is a fork of LTC and is more of a filler. Many old wallets, like Unstoppable, list PoW coins, and DASH is among them. Binance’s mining pool supports few coins, and DASH is one of them, so DASH is chosen as a high-risk “electronic cash” alternative.</p>
<p>Then there is ADA, which has strong academic capabilities and uses a pure PoS consensus with a UTXO model, serving as a PoS counterpart to BTC. ADA is also constantly updated technologically, and if PoS wins one day, ADA is a must-watch, so I expect a better future for ADA.</p>
<p>FIL falls into the category of distributed storage. In computer science, there are two main directions: distributed computing and distributed storage. ETH claims to be the “world computer,” taking on the role of distributed computing, while FIL is the leader in storage. I remember libp2p was developed by Filecoin, and many blockchains, like ETH, use p2p modules directly from libp2p. The widely used IPFS was also developed by the Filecoin lab. Therefore, FIL has strong R&amp;D capabilities, and it may have a breakthrough in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, there are smart contract platforms. I don’t particularly like smart contracts; many people equate smart contracts with blockchain or believe that only blockchains supporting smart contracts are true blockchains. In terms of hoarding coins, coins are just fuel for smart contract platforms, without supply caps, so why hoard them? ETH, SOL, and TON all support smart contracts and are currently very popular, so some allocation is appropriate.</p>
