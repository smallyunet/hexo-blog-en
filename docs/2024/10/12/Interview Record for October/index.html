<ol>
<li>Only recording the companies and dates of the interviews.</li>
<li>I will no longer share my feelings about the interview process to avoid any concerns from companies or interviewers that I might speak negatively and get blacklisted.</li>
<li>I will no longer comment on the interviewers themselves. I’ve <a href="/tags/%E6%89%BE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C/">been to many interviews</a>, and while I’ve always been the one being interviewed, after enough interviews, you start to get a sense of things. So going forward, I won’t comment on the interviewers’ skills or competence.</li>
</ol>
<p>If someone wants to start a business, they must have 200% blind confidence, unwaveringly believing at all times that they are doing the right thing. Otherwise, on the path of entrepreneurship, they will be defeated countless times by others and even by their own self-doubt when challenged.</p>
<p>Job hunting (on one’s career path) is the same. You must have 200% blind confidence, believing that your direction is the right one.</p>

<li><a href="https://nextmate.ai/">Nextmate.ai</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The interviewer was the project manager, currently all-in on this startup project. The project is a Ton mini-game, combining AI with gameplay. They are mainly hiring for front-end development and smart contract development.</p>
<h3 id="September-24"><a href="#September-24" class="headerlink" title="September 24"></a>September 24</h3><ul>
<li>Some unknown company (random application, didn’t have the courage to ask)</li>
</ul>
<p>The team is a market maker, and there are two types of technical roles: pure backend development and strategy development. The team provides quotes to multiple exchanges simultaneously, and the technical work involves calling APIs from various exchanges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gate.io (Browser Department)</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly passed the first round, though I felt my answers were a mess. During the interview, when asked to write code, I was too lazy to do it. The interviewer read my resume on the spot during the interview.</p>
<h3 id="September-25"><a href="#September-25" class="headerlink" title="September 25"></a>September 25</h3><ul>
<li>Gate.io (Browser Department)</li>
</ul>
<p>The second round was a cross-interview. It was only during this round that I found out which department this was and what exactly they were doing, as there was no time for questions in the first round.</p>
<p>(By the way, there are many headhunters recruiting in the name of Gate. The absurd thing is, while other companies’ headhunters at least admit they are headhunters upfront, Gate’s headhunters claim to be Gate HR from the start. However, Gate does have an actual HR interview stage, and that’s the real HR.)</p>
<h3 id="September-26"><a href="#September-26" class="headerlink" title="September 26"></a>September 26</h3><ul>
<li>Cycle Network</li>
</ul>
<p>First round, a standard interview.</p>
<p>I heard the founder of Cycle Network was the head of Baidu’s blockchain department, so it seems the interview process retains some of Baidu’s tradition. In the first round, a frontline worker asks some routine questions and has you write some code.</p>
<h3 id="October-11"><a href="#October-11" class="headerlink" title="October 11"></a>October 11</h3><ul>
<li>Shanghai Jinrun Information Technology Co., Ltd.</li>
</ul>
<p>The company wants to build a consortium blockchain for data recording and traceability purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.arcblock.io/">ArcBlock</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t actually interview with this company, just communicated with HR and decided not to go ahead. Interestingly, you can search on V2EX for the company’s interview process.</p>
