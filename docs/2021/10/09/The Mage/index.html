<p>He came to the foot of the mountain and found that monsters blocked his way up.</p>
<p>The monster’s name was Authority.</p>
<p>He made a deal with the monster, giving up all his previous medals and honors.</p>
<p>He threw away his sword, discarded his armor, and killed his horse.</p>
<p>He could go up the mountain now, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>He needed a new sword.</p>
<p>He went to the nearby magic town, went to the distant treasure mountain.</p>
<p>Went to the best weapon shop, went to the mysterious pirate bay.</p>
<p>A vulture pecked his shoulder, a porcupine blocked his way.</p>
<p>The guard made things difficult for him because of his plain clothes, the judge questioned his lack of talent.</p>
<p>He was tired.</p>
<p>He went back to the inn where he was staying and thought of the past.</p>
<p>He needed to go home.</p>
<p>He wanted to rest.</p>
<p>He even wanted to give up.</p>
<p>He returned to the novice village and met his friends.</p>
<p>He was a triumphant adventurer, he was a fearless warrior.</p>
<p>He had shining armor, he had a proud white horse.</p>
<p>He was no longer a novice, and had no more friends.</p>
<p>He could not fall, nor could he be afraid.</p>
<p>Although he was tired.</p>
<p>One house, lived in for 351 days a year, another house, lived in for 14 days a year.</p>
<p>Which one is home, which one is the inn.</p>
<p>One place, spent 351 days a year, another place, spent 14 days a year.</p>
<p>Where is life, where is the journey.</p>
<p>He returned to the inn, everything started anew, everything remained the same.</p>
<p>He ultimately did not find the sword.</p>
<p>If you see him,</p>
<p>He might be confused,</p>
<p>Or he might be wandering.</p>
<p>Please tell him,</p>
<p>He can keep moving forward,</p>
<p>Or he can take a short break,</p>
<p>Or he can take a few steps back,</p>
<p>He can write a magic book,</p>
<p>He might master advanced spells,</p>
<p>He will become an excellent mage,</p>
<p>And not just a sword-wielding warrior.</p>
