One reason I didn’t publish it earlier is that I couldn’t keep the project well-maintained. It’s challenging to create software that everyone likes and finds suitable, especially when it comes to blog themes that are dependent on various environment versions. Borrowing a line from the movie “Legend of the Demon Cat,” “The events are fake, but the emotions are real.” Best wishes.</p>
<h3 id="Main-Text"><a href="#Main-Text" class="headerlink" title="Main Text"></a>Main Text</h3><p>The blog theme I’m currently using is modeled after Yining Wang’s blog <a href="http://www.yinwang.org/">Of course I’m talking nonsense</a>. A few years ago, I open-sourced the mimicked blog theme on Github (<a href="https://github.com/smallyunet/hexo-theme-yinwang">smallyunet&#x2F;hexo-theme-yinwang</a>). Although I frequently update and optimize my own blog theme, the open-source repository hasn’t been updated for a long time.</p>
<p>On one hand, I’m unsure whether imitating the theme constitutes infringement. On the other hand, I’ve always been troubled by the fact that I don’t want to “earn stars” through such a project. I don’t even want this project to appear on my GitHub homepage, so I had to start customizing the project panel on my homepage. Overall, since this isn’t my original work, it’s like Xia Luo in “Goodbye Mr. Loser,” who became famous in Xihong City by using Jay Chou’s works after traveling back to 1997, only to realize those things weren’t his. He just had a beautiful dream.</p>
<p>Now, I want to continue maintaining this open-source blog theme project.</p>
<p>Hiding it from others or making it uncomfortable for others to use is obviously wrong. Ignorance won’t stop the spread of truth; useful things should be better utilized. I even hope this theme style can become a symbol—a symbol of those inspired by Yining Wang, a symbol of people with integrity and kindness, a symbol of those with true insight.</p>
<p>This isn’t religious fervor. We don’t blindly trust or worship anyone. We advocate <a href="http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2017/11/01/power-of-reasoning">the power of reasoning</a> (by Yining Wang). We don’t form cliques, we don’t promote or force others to use or not use something, we don’t force others to believe or disbelieve something. We idolize someone and consider ourselves their “fans” not because we feel an inexplicable sense of superiority from belonging to a certain group, but because we have learned many valuable and indescribable things from them. When we say we “like someone,” we’re not saying that person is so great, but rather, “we’ve learned something from them, and because of what we’ve learned, we are also great.”</p>
<p>It’s quite surprising that I suddenly thought of this today. It’s a bit unexpected, a bit joyful, and a bit fearful and anxious. Today happens to be Lunar New Year’s Eve. Happy New Year.</p>
