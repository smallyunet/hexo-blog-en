This is something worth striving for.</p>
<p>The truths of life summarized by those in high positions and those far removed from society are similar.</p>
<p>Who is superior to whom, who is more elegant than whom.</p>
<p>Human beings have not evolved in thousands of years, human nature has not changed, instincts have not changed, desires have not changed, stories have not changed, endings have not changed.</p>
<p>It is narrow-minded to view humanity through the lens of technology, and the computer technology that has only existed for less than a hundred years is also narrow-minded.</p>
<p>There are no surprises in the world because there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p>New things happen often because, for individuals, every day is brand new.</p>
<h3 id="Value"><a href="#Value" class="headerlink" title="Value"></a>Value</h3><p>The value of words is not measured by length.</p>
<p>The value of literature will not disappear over time.</p>
<p>A few lines of poetry can be passed down for centuries, recited through the ages.</p>
<p>Lu Xun left both long and short works.</p>
<p>Jay Chou’s songs and Michael Wong’s “First Time,” along with their music videos, are stories that will always move people.</p>
<p>The thoughts on life and philosophy in the Bible have traversed millennia.</p>
<p>There are few bright spots in history, but each one is astonishing.</p>
<p>Many, many more.</p>
<h3 id="Natural-Laws"><a href="#Natural-Laws" class="headerlink" title="Natural Laws"></a>Natural Laws</h3><p>The behavior of living beings conforms to natural laws.</p>
<p>It takes 10 months for two cells to replicate and differentiate into a human being.</p>
<p>The brain receives information, and brain cells form specific structures, which also requires process and time.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of doctor, professor, genius.</p>
<p>So the question changes from “What should I do” to “What can I do at this stage.”</p>
<p>The scope suddenly becomes smaller.</p>
<h3 id="Fairness"><a href="#Fairness" class="headerlink" title="Fairness"></a>Fairness</h3><p>On the second night of the Lunar New Year, at one o’clock in the morning, after the screening of “Hi, Mom.”</p>
<p>I walked on the street and saw people sleeping on benches by the roadside. Whose children are they, whose parents are they, whose relatives are they, whose friends are they?</p>
<p>What do I have more than them, where are they lacking compared to me? Where do they come from, where are they going, why do they persist in living?</p>
<p>Where do I come from, where am I going, why do I want to live?</p>
<p>Are they happy to be alive, are they filled with hope for life, does anyone care about them, do they have a chance and hope for the future?</p>
<p>Could I not fall into such a state?</p>
<p>Even though it’s so close.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bustling-World"><a href="#The-Bustling-World" class="headerlink" title="The Bustling World"></a>The Bustling World</h3><p>At first, I joined some group chats.</p>
<p>Later, I got excited and created my own community.</p>
<p>At first, the group was joined by the rich second generation. They casually sent out red envelopes of 88 yuan each.</p>
<p>Everyone followed eagerly.</p>
<p>Later, the rich second generation left, and everyone tried their best to retain them, vying to reminisce.</p>
<p>The world is bustling, the world is bustling.</p>
<p>At first, everyone felt fresh and happy.</p>
<p>Later, there were no new channels, no new people.</p>
<p>I felt tired because of it.</p>
<p>Many people came, many people left.</p>
<p>I felt uneasy because of it.</p>
<p>Everyone called me the group owner.</p>
<p>I didn’t dare to send messages casually, didn’t dare to spam, afraid of saying something wrong, afraid of accidentally saying something that others didn’t like, afraid of people leaving.</p>
<p>I didn’t dare to casually cue people, worrying about being mistaken for using my identity for personal gain.</p>
<p>As the group owner, there were always people watching.</p>
<p>Thanks to the “group owner” title, I was known by many.</p>
<p>I seriously transferred the “group owner” role to someone else.</p>
<p>What a relief.</p>
