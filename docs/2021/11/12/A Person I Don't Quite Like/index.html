<p>When I was an intern, it coincided with policy suppression and company layoffs. Half of the interns in the same batch were let go, including a colleague from another team in my department. It should be the department leader at that time who handed over my resume to another department, and I was transferred to the blockchain department later.</p>
<p>The first person I met in the new department was that person, who was also the leader. From the conversation, it seemed that he had seen the blog address I left on my resume. After that, all my work was assigned by the team leader, starting with web development and later on to other tasks.</p>
<p>Shortly after I graduated and became a full-time employee, that leader left the company to become a partner at a startup that is currently working on an open-source consortium blockchain. Because of this, I don’t have much confidence in the technology of that open-source consortium blockchain. At first, I even felt I could see a bit of my previous company’s blockchain product in their project. Maybe all consortium blockchains are like that.</p>
<p>At his farewell ceremony, I remember him saying some things I didn’t like.</p>
<p><strong>“Some people leave right on time after work, not working overtime. How can they improve themselves?”</strong></p>
<p>It seemed he also said that although he left early, he continued working at home. It’s been too long, I can’t remember the exact words, but that was the gist. Of course, he wasn’t saying it to me directly but to everyone, not targeting anyone specifically.</p>
<p>Although I was still young at the time and could handle working overtime, I completely disagreed with that kind of jerk logic. Later, the company required 996 work hours for a while. I could manage to be the earliest to arrive and the last to leave, just short of sleeping at the company. Besides, I was quite serious at work, mainly doing simple web development, my old profession. And how do you know you’re the only one doing useful things after work hours?</p>
<p><strong>“If my startup fails, I hope you all can leave a position for me.”</strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t understand this statement. If you’ve already left, why still think about a way back? Unfortunately, “everyone” fell faster than his startup career, perhaps because he left.</p>
<p><strong>“None of you are capable!”</strong></p>
<p>At a dinner, someone said, “If you start a business, take us with you?” And then he said this. Finally, he spoke his mind when leaving, haha.</p>
<p>There’s nothing much after that. In short, I felt I saw the classic image of a greasy uncle. I remember I started feeling dizzy after two glasses of baijiu.</p>
<p>The next time we met was at a department team-building event, and he was invited too. He was quite familiar with the department leader. Another department leader also joined the team-building.</p>
<p>During the meal, the other department leader mentioned a cliché question, and no one really responded. Then the topic shifted to whether there were any women in his startup, and if so, could he introduce some to us.</p>
<p><strong>“There are women. (pauses) Female PhDs!”</strong></p>
<p>This kind of statement almost completely contradicts my values. The implication was, PhDs, huh! And what about you?</p>
<p>On an anonymous community, you can find comments about their company saying it has the corrupt culture of a state-owned enterprise combined with the excellent tradition of overtime and on-call duties of an internet company.</p>
<p>Once, during a major product release live broadcast, they were chatting and laughing, the atmosphere was lax, and both the attire and environment were very low-end.</p>
<p>In the same year he left to start his own business, their company began working on their current project, maybe a few months later. Anyway, not much time has passed since then, and they don’t have many people, but they release versions quite frequently. I saw him post on his moments saying they aim to build the best blockchain platform in China.</p>
<p>Looking at their presentations in other live meetings, the most striking thing is a slide listing a bunch of guiding and member units.</p>
<p>Occasionally, headhunters contact me, saying that the company is recruiting.</p>
<p>For these special reasons, I might never go or be able to go to that kind of high-end company with female PhDs.</p>
