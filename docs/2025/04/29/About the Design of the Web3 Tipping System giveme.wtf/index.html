Similar Web2 platforms include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/">https://buymeacoffee.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linktr.ee/">https://linktr.ee/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is that the personal page on giveme.wtf will display Web3 wallet receiving addresses and QR codes, much like a personal PayPal payment link. It will support multiple chain address formats including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc., and users can choose freely.</p>
<p>giveme.wtf will not act as an intermediary for funds; it will simply display tipping address information. For example, visiting giveme.wtf&#x2F;{username} will show the receiving address info set up by the user, including Ethereum address text and QR code. That’s it.</p>
<p>Of course, on giveme.wtf&#x2F;{username}, users can also set a simple bio, avatar, domain, social media, etc., like a small personal homepage, making it more shareable.</p>
<h3 id="Technical-Implementation"><a href="#Technical-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Technical Implementation"></a>Technical Implementation</h3><ul>
<li>Registration</li>
</ul>
<p>Users register with a MetaMask wallet. After connecting the wallet, they can set a unique, globally-managed username via a smart contract. This requires a transaction to submit the desired username to the contract.</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile Info</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the EVM address is bound to the username, users can set their profile info including avatar, bio, wallet addresses, etc.</p>
<p>After entering the info, the frontend sends it to the backend, which saves it on an IPFS node (pinned for long-term), and returns the CID to the frontend.</p>
<p>The frontend, after receiving the CID, initiates another contract interaction to write the username-&gt;CID mapping into the smart contract. This step can be combined with registration or kept separate, since users may want to register without setting a profile.</p>
<ul>
<li>Display</li>
</ul>
<p>The on-chain username-&gt;CID is the authoritative data. The frontend fetches the CID from the contract based on the username in giveme.wtf&#x2F;{username}, then queries the IPFS gateway for the data and renders the page.</p>
<p>Profiles are minimal JSON data, very small in size. To speed up gateway queries, Cloudflare’s Web3 gateway CDN can be used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Selection</li>
</ul>
<p>The smart contract is deployed on Base.</p>
<h3 id="Extensions-and-Optimizations"><a href="#Extensions-and-Optimizations" class="headerlink" title="Extensions and Optimizations"></a>Extensions and Optimizations</h3><p>Later, on-chain data can be used to generate statistics like which receiving addresses are using the tipping system, total amount tipped, and make a leaderboard categorized by username or chain.</p>
<p>Ranking can boost the exposure of the bio under each username. Upvote your idol to keep them at the top.</p>
<p>We can also add 24-hour leaderboards or competitive ranking formats.</p>
<p>The system could also be extended into a social network. Tipping history could form relationship graphs, and even evolve into an IM tool with auto group creation, etc.</p>
<h4 id="Username-Recovery"><a href="#Username-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Username Recovery"></a>Username Recovery</h4><p>A drawback of MetaMask registration is what happens if a wallet is lost—does that mean username control is lost too? A recovery mechanism can be designed, such as allowing each username to set a list of recovery addresses. Any address in this list can reclaim control and update the CID. This is aimed at lost wallets.</p>
<p>What if the wallet gets hacked? Wouldn’t the hacker just change the recovery list? Yes, once a hacker has control of the username, they could reinforce it by changing to their own address. Is there a way to regain control after a hack? Not in Web3.</p>
<h4 id="Network-Selection"><a href="#Network-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Network Selection"></a>Network Selection</h4><p>Currently, a chain must be chosen to deploy the smart contract, which ensures data integrity. Choosing a chain is tricky, as users might not hold tokens on-chain.</p>
<p>For example, choosing Base requires users to have ETH and also ETH on Base, which can be a big hurdle.</p>
<p>To solve this, gas fee abstraction can be considered—using a paymaster from ERC-4337 (which has mostly faded), or the older Meta Transaction method. However, we also have to prevent abuse and ensure we can afford to subsidize fees.</p>
<h4 id="Data-Availability"><a href="#Data-Availability" class="headerlink" title="Data Availability"></a>Data Availability</h4><p>In the MVP, data is stored on IPFS, but there’s only one server. IPFS is a low-level file routing protocol, and we can wrap it with a simpler layer like Filecoin, but less complex due to small data volume. PoST is complex due to encryption&#x2F;decryption for large files, but giveme.wtf’s data is small. We can just verify a Merkle Root Hash, meaning a lightweight verification and incentive system on top of IPFS. Nodes that store full data could receive rewards after periodic checks. Details of rewards are TBD.</p>
<h4 id="Off-Chain-Data-Caching"><a href="#Off-Chain-Data-Caching" class="headerlink" title="Off-Chain Data Caching"></a>Off-Chain Data Caching</h4><p>Querying username-&gt;CID from the contract every time is slow and uses RPC resources. We should cache this off-chain via a centralized backend that listens to contract events and writes username-&gt;CID to Cloudflare Workers KV.</p>
<p>Frontend should first query Cloudflare Workers KV, and fallback to the contract if unavailable.</p>
<p>But what if the centralized service is compromised and changes username-&gt;CID? Funds could be misdirected.</p>
<p>This is a data integrity problem that Optimistic Rollup also solves. Here’s a possible approach combined with Zetachain’s cross-chain logic.</p>
<p>First, the off-chain caching service builds a Merkle Tree using all username-&gt;CID data. The resulting Merkle Root Hash is the integrity proof and is regularly submitted on-chain. Frontend checks this root hash on-chain to verify if the cached CID is tampered.</p>
<p>Also, multiple indexer programs can agree on a TSS key. Only this key can submit Merkle Root Hashes. They will only agree if all their root hashes match—effectively multi-signature.</p>
<p>Finally, introduce a cool-down + challenge period. After submission, the root hash doesn’t take effect immediately. Anyone can challenge it. If successful, the new root is invalidated, and the old one remains. Designing a reliable challenge mechanism is complex, but it’s something to optimize in the future.</p>
