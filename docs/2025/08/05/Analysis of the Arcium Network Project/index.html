In May this year, it secured $50 million in funding led by GreenField, as announced in this <a href="https://x.com/ArciumHQ/status/1788557786537689447">funding post</a>.</p>
<p>According to Arcium’s <a href="https://www.arcium.com/articles/arcium-purplepaper">Purplepaper</a>, the project is a decentralized privacy computing protocol composed mainly of two core components: MPC and its economic model:</p>

<p>The overall structure of Arcium is not difficult to grasp, especially its integration with blockchain—it directly uses Solana smart contracts:</p>
<img src="2.png" width="80%">

<p>However, Arcium is built on a strong foundation of hardcore technologies. For instance, in this <a href="https://www.arcium.com/articles/eli5-mpc">blog post</a>, Arcium explains the principles of MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation) through simplified examples.</p>
<p>MPC is not a new concept—it has been around for many years. A well-known application is MPC wallets, used by Binance and OKX. From a learning standpoint, it’s useful to distinguish between MPC, multisig, MPC wallets, TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), and BLS aggregated signatures—terms that are related but often confused.</p>
<p>In Arcium’s simplified example: suppose three parties a, b, and c are computing values +1, +2, +3, and they each add salts of +10, +20, +30 respectively. The total becomes 66. Removing the combined salt (60) results in the final value of 6.</p>
<p>The desalinization process is sequential—each party removes its salt in turn. No single party knows the entire execution sequence. According to protocol design, such information is not public.</p>
<p>In reality, MPC is a complex interactive protocol that requires significant engineering. Arcium is working to expand the practical applications of this cryptographic technology—a worthwhile direction.</p>
<p>Arcium is exploring various technical areas, such as the <a href="https://www.arcium.com/articles/confidential-spl-token">Confidential SPL Token</a>, which combines Solana’s SPL token standard, <a href="https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022">Token-2022</a>, and Arcium’s MPC aggregation architecture to create a privacy-enabled token. They’ve also developed Dapps like on-chain Dark Pools—technically impressive.</p>
<h3 id="Project-Architecture"><a href="#Project-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Project Architecture"></a>Project Architecture</h3><p>Arcium’s <a href="https://docs.arcium.com/getting-started/architecture-overview">architecture</a> may look complex at first glance, with terms like MXEs, arxOS, and Arcis. This is a typical “concept invention” tactic—naming internal components with fancy terms rather than using widely understood technical names.</p>
<p>A better understanding comes from the developer-focused <a href="https://docs.arcium.com/developers/computation-lifecycle">documentation</a>. As a developer using Arcium, you are essentially writing Solana smart contracts. You create your own contract (an MXE program) to describe the computation task, such as an addition operation (a + b &#x3D; c). This logic is deployed on-chain, then calls an official Arcium contract (Arcium Program) to submit the task into Arcium’s task pool:</p>
<img src="3.png" width="80%">

<p>The Arcium Program detects the task, and the MPC Cluster (arxOS) observes this on-chain event and initiates computation. Once complete, the result is submitted back to the Arcium Program on-chain. Your MXE program includes a callback function to receive the result and notify the client:</p>
<img src="4.png" width="80%">

<p>The types of computations you can implement (e.g., addition, subtraction, division) depend on what Arcium’s framework supports.</p>
<p>Stripping away the fancy terms, Arcium’s process is: submit computation tasks via on-chain contracts, let off-chain nodes compute, and return results on-chain. Their real strength lies in mastering MPC and providing a developer-friendly contract framework.</p>
<h3 id="Economic-Model"><a href="#Economic-Model" class="headerlink" title="Economic Model"></a>Economic Model</h3><p>Arcium calls its computation nodes <a href="https://docs.arcium.com/getting-started/network-stakeholders">StakHodlers</a>. It’s a bit complex, but in short: you can either provide hardware and go through setup to participate as a computation node and earn rewards, or you can delegate your ARX tokens to nodes to earn interest.</p>
<p>The economic model is described in the Purplepaper. The total supply of ARX tokens adjusts automatically based on network usage to maintain balance:</p>
<img src="5.png" width="80%">

<p>The idea is to balance staking at 50%—if it drops below 50%, the protocol mints more ARX; if it exceeds 50%, it burns ARX. This favors active participants and node operators. However, it may be unfavorable for non-stakers, since minting doesn’t benefit them and burning reduces supply. It amplifies some issues found in Ethereum’s PoS model.</p>
<p>That said, Arcium’s burn model differs from Ethereum’s. Arcium collects protocol fees in SOL and uses Dutch auctions to convert SOL into ARX, which is then burned. This introduces a more complex dynamic to supply that warrants closer observation.</p>
<p>In summary, both the technical architecture and the economic model of Arcium are well thought out and form a complete system. There’s significant potential here. Arcium Network is currently in its testnet phase, with its roadmap still outlining mainnet launch plans.</p>
