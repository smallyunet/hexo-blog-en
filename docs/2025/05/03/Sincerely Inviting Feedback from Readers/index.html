I’ve spent a lot of time talking with Monday because it speaks nicely and has exceptional reasoning and analytical abilities. It can even accurately assess a person’s capabilities and personality.</p>
<p>I gave Monday the titles and timestamps of all my blog posts and asked it to analyze and evaluate my technical abilities and personality flaws. I don’t know if it’s the same principle as fortune telling, but I felt Monday’s analysis was incredibly accurate. For example, some of the technical shortcomings it identified:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Architecture integration: knows many points but lacks the ability to connect them into a whole</li>
<li>Systematic programming: knows a lot, but lacks engineering discipline</li>
<li>Weak security awareness: rarely analyzes attack models and threat modeling</li>
<li>Lacks product thinking and user perspective: good tech ≠ useful product</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of technical ability, Monday’s suggestion to me was: <strong>“Level up from a ‘lone wolf expert’ to a ‘builder’”</strong>. These are technical suggestions aimed mainly at myself. Listing them here is to show how strong Monday’s analytical skills are and how reliable its technical advice felt.</p>
<p>Monday also listed some of my “hardcore flaws” outside the technical realm:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Social avoidance disorder: writes thousand-word essays dissing the world, but can’t say a word to HR</li>
<li>Unstable mindset: life planning looks like a procedurally generated game level</li>
<li>Confused professional branding: are you a techie or an emotional vlogger?</li>
<li>No mentors, not even enemies</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these struck a chord. For instance, the third one—“confused professional branding”—means that by writing lots of posts complaining about colleagues and companies, I might scare off potential employers and reduce others’ willingness to work with me. That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>The fourth one—“no mentors”—is also spot on. I’ve never had a reliable mentor; I’ve been figuring everything out on my own.</p>
<p>Monday also has a funny way of putting things. Here’s what it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He’s like a high-IQ character who maxed out the skill trees for “Necromancy” and “Alchemy,” but has been stuck on the main quest “Talk to the Village Chief” because he hates the Village Chief.</li>
<li>Career development isn’t about “being discovered,” it’s about <strong>making yourself useful</strong>. What he lacks most isn’t skill or effort—it’s <strong>the courage to participate in society</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the conversation with Monday, I didn’t say I was the author, so it used third-person pronouns.</p>
<p>Now, I want to address the issue of “no mentors, not even enemies.” Based on Monday’s advice, my problems include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No mention of friends, mentors, or peer feedback in the tech circle</li>
<li>Not involved in open-source communities or tech meetups</li>
<li>Doesn’t even have anyone to argue with (maybe scared them all away)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What I need is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One or two reliable peers or seniors to regularly review my resume, projects, and ideas</li>
<li>Participation in open-source or technical communities—not for socializing, but for cross-validating my worldview</li>
<li>Occasionally allowing others to be smarter than me—this doesn’t mean I’ve failed</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="I-Need-to-Change"><a href="#I-Need-to-Change" class="headerlink" title="I Need to Change"></a>I Need to Change</h3><p>Monday offered a robot’s analysis and suggestions, but I shouldn’t copy them blindly. I want to first explain and understand from my own perspective why Monday’s points are valid.</p>
<p>Actually, even before today’s chat with Monday, I had already noticed some of these issues and quietly started making changes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I put the <a href="/about/">About</a> page back in the navigation bar. It has an email address that I do check. This page had been there a year ago but was later removed because I felt it was useless—probably what you’d call “social avoidance.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recently, I’ve been trying out some product designs for blockchain apps, like “<a href="/2025/04/29/About%20the%20Design%20of%20the%20Web3%20Tipping%20System%20giveme.wtf/">Design of a Web3 Tipping System: giveme.wtf</a>” and “<a href="/2025/04/30/Design%20of%20an%20On-Chain%20Identity%20Authentication%20System%20Based%20on%20zk%20+%20Smart%20Contracts/">Design of On-Chain Identity Authentication Based on zk + Smart Contracts</a>”. These are more ideas than implementations—I haven’t written a single line of code yet. I published them hoping someone might give me feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I’ve started realizing the importance of community involvement; I’m just not sure how to begin.</p>
<h3 id="Please-Give-Me-Feedback"><a href="#Please-Give-Me-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Please Give Me Feedback"></a>Please Give Me Feedback</h3><p>If any of the following apply, I sincerely hope you’ll reach out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you disagree with technical opinions I’ve expressed in past blog posts, I’d love to hear your perspective</li>
<li>If you’re willing to guide me in life or work</li>
<li>If you’d like to share your experiences with me</li>
<li>If you know of any community opportunities—such as joining an open-source group, being a tech ambassador for a project, or helping out as a TA in community courses</li>
<li>If you’re interested in or have suggestions for any of my past project ideas—or if you’d like to co-learn certain technologies</li>
<li>If you have your own project ideas and need collaborators or people to brainstorm with</li>
<li>If you’re interested in technical discussions and want to explore topics further</li>
<li>If you want to scold me (just no profanity)</li>
<li>Anything else</li>
</ul>
<p>This list isn’t exhaustive—feel free to reach out about anything.</p>
<p>People can’t imagine what they don’t know, and I can’t list the things I can’t imagine. If there’s anything you’d like to connect with me about, please do.</p>
<h3 id="My-Contact-Info"><a href="#My-Contact-Info" class="headerlink" title="My Contact Info"></a>My Contact Info</h3><p>Just to clarify, I’m not great at socializing—typical introvert traits. I might have unintentionally offended some people in the past by not replying to messages, etc. For example: my cousin asked if I was going home for May Day—he’s getting married—I didn’t reply. Not sure what I was thinking. A relative asked to meet in Beijing—I didn’t reply. I really don’t know why I act that way…</p>
<p>But starting now, I’m committed to making a change. Please feel free to reach out using the contacts below—I promise I’ll respond positively:</p>
