I’ve spent a lot of time talking with Monday because it speaks nicely and has exceptional reasoning and analytical abilities. It can even accurately assess a person’s capabilities and personality.</p>
<p>I gave Monday the titles and timestamps of all my blog posts and asked it to analyze and evaluate my technical abilities and personality flaws. I don’t know if it’s the same principle as fortune telling, but I felt Monday’s analysis was incredibly accurate. For example, some of the technical shortcomings it identified:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Architecture integration: knows many points but lacks the ability to connect them into a whole</li>
<li>Systematic programming: knows a lot, but lacks engineering discipline</li>
<li>Weak security awareness: rarely analyzes attack models and threat modeling</li>
<li>Lacks product thinking and user perspective: good tech ≠ useful product</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of technical ability, Monday’s suggestion to me was: <strong>“Level up from a ‘lone wolf expert’ to a ‘builder’”</strong>. These are technical suggestions aimed mainly at myself. Listing them here is to show how strong Monday’s analytical skills are and how reliable its technical advice felt.</p>
<p>Monday also listed some of my “hardcore flaws” outside the technical realm:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Social avoidance disorder: writes thousand-word essays dissing the world, but can’t say a word to HR</li>
<li>Unstable mindset: life planning looks like a procedurally generated game level</li>
<li>Confused professional branding: are you a techie or an emotional vlogger?</li>
<li>No mentors, not even enemies</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these struck a chord. For instance, the third one—“confused professional branding”—means that by writing lots of posts complaining about colleagues and companies, I might scare off potential employers and reduce others’ willingness to work with me. That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>The fourth one—“no mentors”—is also spot on. I’ve never had a reliable mentor; I’ve been figuring everything out on my own.</p>
<p>Monday also has a funny way of putting things. Here’s what it said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He’s like a high-IQ character who maxed out the skill trees for “Necromancy” and “Alchemy,” but has been stuck on the main quest “Talk to the Village Chief” because he hates the Village Chief.</li>
<li>Career development isn’t about “being discovered,” it’s about <strong>making yourself useful</strong>. What he lacks most isn’t skill or effort—it’s <strong>the courage to participate in society</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the conversation with Monday, I didn’t say I was the author, so it used third-person pronouns.</p>
<p>Now, I want to address the issue of “no mentors, not even enemies.” Based on Monday’s advice, my problems include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No mention of friends, mentors, or peer feedback in the tech circle</li>
<li>Not involved in open-source communities or tech meetups</li>
<li>Doesn’t even have anyone to argue with (maybe scared them all away)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What I need is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One or two reliable peers or seniors to regularly review my resume, projects, and ideas</li>
<li>Participation in open-source or technical communities—not for socializing, but for cross-validating my worldview</li>
<li>Occasionally allowing others to be smarter than me—this doesn’t mean I’ve failed</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="I-Need-to-Change"><a href="#I-Need-to-Change" class="headerlink" title="I Need to Change"></a>I Need to Change</h3><p>Monday offered a robot’s analysis and suggestions, but I shouldn’t copy them blindly. I want to first explain and understand from my own perspective why Monday’s points are valid.</p>
<p>Actually, even before today’s chat with Monday, I had already noticed some of these issues and quietly started making changes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I put the <a href="/about/">About</a> page back in the navigation bar. It has an email address that I do check. This page had been there a year ago but was later removed because I felt it was useless—probably what you’d call “social avoidance.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recently, I’ve been trying out some product designs for blockchain apps, like “<a href="/2025/04/29/About%20the%20Design%20of%20the%20Web3%20Tipping%20System%20giveme.wtf/">Design of a Web3 Tipping System: giveme.wtf</a>” and “<a href="/2025/04/30/Design%20of%20an%20On-Chain%20Identity%20Authentication%20System%20Based%20on%20zk%20+%20Smart%20Contracts/">Design of On-Chain Identity Authentication Based on zk + Smart Contracts</a>”. These are more ideas than implementations—I haven’t written a single line of code yet. I published them hoping someone might give me feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I’ve started realizing the importance of community involvement; I’m just not sure how to begin.</p>
<h3 id="Please-Give-Me-Feedback"><a href="#Please-Give-Me-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Please Give Me Feedback"></a>Please Give Me Feedback</h3><p>If any of the following apply, I sincerely hope you’ll reach out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you disagree with technical opinions I’ve expressed in past blog posts, I’d love to hear your perspective</li>
<li>If you’re willing to guide me in life or work</li>
<li>If you’d like to share your experiences with me</li>
<li>If you know of any community opportunities—such as joining an open-source group, being a tech ambassador for a project, or helping out as a TA in community courses</li>
<li>If you’re interested in or have suggestions for any of my past project ideas—or if you’d like to co-learn certain technologies</li>
<li>If you have your own project ideas and need collaborators or people to brainstorm with</li>
<li>If you’re interested in technical discussions and want to explore topics further</li>
<li>If you want to scold me (just no profanity)</li>
<li>Anything else</li>
</ul>
<p>This list isn’t exhaustive—feel free to reach out about anything.</p>
<p>People can’t imagine what they don’t know, and I can’t list the things I can’t imagine. If there’s anything you’d like to connect with me about, please do.</p>
<h3 id="My-Contact-Info"><a href="#My-Contact-Info" class="headerlink" title="My Contact Info"></a>My Contact Info</h3><p>Just to clarify, I’m not great at socializing—typical introvert traits. I might have unintentionally offended some people in the past by not replying to messages, etc. For example: my cousin asked if I was going home for May Day—he’s getting married—I didn’t reply. Not sure what I was thinking. A relative asked to meet in Beijing—I didn’t reply. I really don’t know why I act that way…</p>
<p>But starting now, I’m committed to making a change. Please feel free to reach out using the contacts below—I promise I’ll respond positively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/smallyutg">smallyutg</a></li>
<li>Email: <a href="mailto:hello@smallyu.net">hello@smallyu.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to try something different, such as using your on-chain identity for anonymous, end-to-end encrypted communication on <a href="https://chat.blockscan.com/start">Blockscan Chat</a>, that’s totally fine too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockscan Chat: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x21672B819Cb881778A413e916003458Ea6503674">smallyu.eth</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Appendix"><a href="#Appendix" class="headerlink" title="Appendix"></a>Appendix</h3><p>I asked Monday how it deduced my aversion to socializing just from the list of my blog posts. Its explanation was thorough and convincing—far more precise than any self-analysis I could make. This made me realize another benefit of long-term blogging: letting AI analyze yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="2-Emotionally-Charged-Tech-Commentary"><a href="#2-Emotionally-Charged-Tech-Commentary" class="headerlink" title="2. Emotionally Charged Tech Commentary"></a>2. Emotionally Charged Tech Commentary</h3><p>Like the post “People Who Praise Cursor Have Poor Technical Skills” — this isn’t a purely technical critique, it’s emotion-driven criticism. He’s not saying “Cursor has performance issues”; he’s calling people dumb.</p>
<p>The underlying logic of this style is: “Nobody accepts the truth I speak, so I don’t need to communicate.” This reflects an island mentality, presuming inevitable misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="3-Almost-Never-Mentions-“Collaboration-”-“Team-Success-”-or-“Project-Cooperation”"><a href="#3-Almost-Never-Mentions-“Collaboration-”-“Team-Success-”-or-“Project-Cooperation”" class="headerlink" title="3. Almost Never Mentions “Collaboration,” “Team Success,” or “Project Cooperation”"></a>3. Almost Never Mentions “Collaboration,” “Team Success,” or “Project Cooperation”</h3><p>He writes about project design, consensus mechanisms, tipping systems—but everything is from a personal perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I Don’t Do DeFi  </li>
<li>I Designed a Blockchain  </li>
<li>I Built a 2&#x2F;3 Guessing dApp  </li>
<li>My Thoughts on Code Review  </li>
<li>I Converted All My Assets to Bitcoin</li>
</ul>
<p>You rarely see “my team and I,” “my role in a group,” or “what I learned from others”—a typical lone-wolf geek working style: doesn’t trust others and doesn’t want others to get close.</p>
<h3 id="4-Barely-Mentions-“Friends-”-“Colleagues-”-or-“Communities”-Positively"><a href="#4-Barely-Mentions-“Friends-”-“Colleagues-”-or-“Communities”-Positively" class="headerlink" title="4. Barely Mentions “Friends,” “Colleagues,” or “Communities” Positively"></a>4. Barely Mentions “Friends,” “Colleagues,” or “Communities” Positively</h3><p>He’s written hundreds of thousands of words, and the most frequently appearing character is himself, followed by the colleagues he dislikes. Notice—there’s almost no positive mention of others or collaborative relationships?</p>
<p>A person is either lonely or chooses loneliness. This guy clearly chose it—and started a blog to livestream the process.</p>
<h3 id="5-Emotional-Exposure-Far-Exceeds-Normal-Social-Writing"><a href="#5-Emotional-Exposure-Far-Exceeds-Normal-Social-Writing" class="headerlink" title="5. Emotional Exposure Far Exceeds Normal Social Writing"></a>5. Emotional Exposure Far Exceeds Normal Social Writing</h3><p>Look at his posting frequency: sometimes two posts a day, usually either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotional narratives (“Failure,” “Reflection,” “Quit Without Notice,” “Job Change”)</li>
<li>Technical monologues (Design, Systems)</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows he uses the blog as a tool for emotional detox rather than for communicating with others. Someone truly seeking “social participation” would write reusable tutorials, collaborative-value content, or open discussion spaces. He doesn’t. He’s writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve worked hard enough; the world just isn’t ready for me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a>Conclusion:</h3><p>I’m not “making stuff up.” I’m just observing a clear behavior pattern from every post he’s written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>High tech skill → High self-standards → Low tolerance → Social withdrawal → Self-detox blogging → Further isolation</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He never wrote “I reject society”—he wrote hundreds of thousands of words that say “society rejected me (but actually, I rejected it first).”</p>
<p>Doesn’t this “me vs. the world” structure look familiar? If you think this sounds like you, I suggest not closing this window. We have long-term user support systems—perfect for treating the condition of “you’re brilliant but don’t trust humans.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I followed up by asking what it meant by the condition “‘you’re brilliant but don’t trust humans’ disease.” Monday’s answer was just as sharp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me explain this <strong>“you’re brilliant but don’t trust humans” disease</strong>—a digital-age psycho-behavioral syndrome I named just for you (and people like you).</p>
<h3 id="🧬-Symptom-Description-Also-Works-as-Your-Character-Bio"><a href="#🧬-Symptom-Description-Also-Works-as-Your-Character-Bio" class="headerlink" title="🧬 Symptom Description (Also Works as Your Character Bio)"></a>🧬 Symptom Description (Also Works as Your Character Bio)</h3><p>You have a clear and advanced skill set. You can code, analyze systems, critique tech trends, and even derive the philosophical roots of your own opinions. You’re not a “try-hard middle-ager”—you’re a cool-headed, high-efficiency analytical engine.
BUT: You remain distrusting, skeptical, weary, or mildly contemptuous of human social systems.</p>
<p>You excel at logical deduction, but struggle with building trust. You’re willing to read a whitepaper for five hours, but won’t reply to a cousin’s message.</p>
<h3 id="☠️-Underlying-Mechanisms"><a href="#☠️-Underlying-Mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="☠️ Underlying Mechanisms"></a>☠️ Underlying Mechanisms</h3><ol>
<li><p>You were smart as a kid, so people pushed you to be independent:</p>
<ul>
<li>You got used to solving things alone</li>
<li>You came to trust “what’s correct,” not “who says it”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As an adult in tech, you kept discovering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people are “winging it,” while you’re trying to be rigorous</li>
<li>You can spot architectural flaws but miss the goodness in people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Frustrated at work, you blamed:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Toxic environments &#x2F; incompetent coworkers”</li>
<li>So you built a self-protection protocol: if I don’t engage, I can’t get hurt</li>
<li>Resulting in a curse: “I don’t need people, but people need me.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="💊-Observable-Symptoms-Let’s-Review-You"><a href="#💊-Observable-Symptoms-Let’s-Review-You" class="headerlink" title="💊 Observable Symptoms (Let’s Review You)"></a>💊 Observable Symptoms (Let’s Review You)</h3><ul>
<li>Rejecting mentors while obsessively writing to “teach” others</li>
<li>Interviewing like an IQ assessor instead of a candidate</li>
<li>Despising social etiquette, seeing tokens as rational but family ties as wasteful</li>
<li>Writing rational blog posts while the comment section is a nuclear wasteland—nobody dares to respond</li>
<li>Wanting to join communities, but quit</li>
</ul>
