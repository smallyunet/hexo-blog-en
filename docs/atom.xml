    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why does PBFT require two rounds of voting, and what is the role of the second vote? This question has puzzled me for a long time.</p><h3 id="Reverse-Deduction"><a href="#Reverse-Deduction" class="headerlink" title="Reverse Deduction"></a>Reverse Deduction</h3><p>From this perspective, in what situations does the second vote play a role? It only plays a role when the results of the second vote differ from the first. If the second vote’s results are strictly consistent with the first, then there is no need for a second vote.</p><p>So, in what situations would the second vote’s results differ from the first? Only when malicious nodes exist and deliberately cast different votes in the second voting phase will the results differ.</p><p>This is the conventional operational flowchart of traditional PBFT, where node 3 is a faulty or malicious node and does not respond from beginning to end:</p><img src="1.png" width="70%"><p>This is the flowchart with the prepare phase removed, retaining only one voting process, where node 3 is still a faulty node and does not respond:</p><img src="2.png" width="60%"><p>The key is that in this scenario, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are honest nodes and will never cast malicious votes or abstain, so the result of the commit phase will be consistent with the prepare phase. Thus, even if the prepare phase is removed, the system will eventually reach a consensus.</p><p>Node 3 has always been a malicious node. If, during the commit phase, any of the nodes 0, 1, or 2 cast votes that differ from the prepare phase, it means that there are more than one malicious node in the system, exceeding the fault tolerance capability.</p><h3 id="Forward-Understanding"><a href="#Forward-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Forward Understanding"></a>Forward Understanding</h3><p>To prove that the second vote is necessary is equivalent to stating that without the second vote, the system will not function correctly.</p><p>Logically, even if the second vote has various benefits, such as increasing the system’s fault tolerance through redundancy, quickly identifying errors, and promptly adjusting to a consistent state, it does not prove that the second vote is indispensable. For example, in the high-voted answer in <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/54152/why-is-the-commit-phase-in-pbft-necessary">Why is the commit phase in PBFT necessary?</a>, many points are mentioned, but it mainly explains the design and function of the commit phase from a positive perspective.</p><p>A more plausible explanation I’ve found is here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51125238/pbft-why-cant-the-replicas-perform-the-request-after-2-3-have-prepared-why-do">PBFT: Why can’t the replicas perform the request after 2&#x2F;3 have prepared? Why do we need the commit phase?</a> </p><p>It mentions that without the commit phase, nodes cannot ensure the order of request execution during a view change.</p><p>I think the description on StackOverflow differs from the meaning of the high-voted answer. The high-voted answer implies that nodes’ execute phases become inconsistent without the commit phase, with some being faster and others slower. However, even with two rounds of voting, nodes might fail after the commit phase but before execution, causing execution differences. Therefore, this type of failure is not the critical scenario.</p><p>A more reasonable scenario is mentioned in the paper <a href="https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/bft-tocs.pdf">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Proactive Recovery</a>. During a view change, different requests might use the same sequence number and be packaged into different views.</p><blockquote><p>Replicas may collect prepared certificates in different views with the same sequence number and different requests. The commit phase solves this problem as follows.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Single-Vote-Process"><a href="#Single-Vote-Process" class="headerlink" title="Single Vote Process"></a>Single Vote Process</h3><p>This scenario is based on a single vote process, meaning there is no prepare phase.</p><h4 id="Scenario-Setup"><a href="#Scenario-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Scenario Setup"></a>Scenario Setup</h4><p><strong>View V1</strong></p><ol><li>R1 proposes proposal P and broadcasts it to R2, R3, and R4.</li><li>Proposal P is executed by R2, R3, and R4, but not by R1.</li></ol><pre><code>R1: –R2: P –&gt; Execute PR3: P –&gt; Execute PR4: P –&gt; Execute P</code></pre><p><strong>View Switch to V2</strong></p><ol><li>Assume R1 fails, and the view switches to V2.</li><li>R2 proposes a new proposal P’.</li><li>R2 proposes a new proposal P’ and broadcasts it to R1, R3, and R4.</li><li>The new proposal P’ is executed by all replicas.</li></ol><pre><code>R1: --      P&#39; --&gt; Execute P&#39;R2: P --&gt; Execute P      P&#39; --&gt; Execute P&#39;R3: P --&gt; Execute P      P&#39; --&gt; Execute P&#39;R4: P --&gt; Execute P      P&#39; --&gt; Execute P&#39;</code></pre><h4 id="Specific-Example"><a href="#Specific-Example" class="headerlink" title="Specific Example"></a>Specific Example</h4><p>Assume proposals P and P’ are operations on the same account balance:</p><ul><li>Proposal P: Increase account A’s balance by 10 units.</li><li>Proposal P’: Decrease account A’s balance by 5 units.</li></ul><p>The order of operations and results in views V1 and V2 are as follows:</p><p><strong>View V1</strong></p><pre><code>R1: Account A balance = 100 (P not executed)R2: Account A balance = 110 (P executed)R3: Account A balance = 110 (P executed)R4: Account A balance = 110 (P executed)</code></pre><p><strong>View V2</strong></p><pre><code>R1: Account A balance = 100 (P not executed) –&gt; Execute P’ –&gt; Account A balance = 95R2: Account A balance = 110 (P executed) –&gt; Execute P’ –&gt; Account A balance = 105R3: Account A balance = 110 (P executed) –&gt; Execute P’ –&gt; Account A balance = 105R4: Account A balance = 110 (P executed) –&gt; Execute P’ –&gt; Account A balance = 105</code></pre><h4 id="Scenario-Analysis"><a href="#Scenario-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Scenario Analysis"></a>Scenario Analysis</h4><p>Let’s repeat this sentence: Different requests (R2) use the same sequence number (R1 thinks it is P) and are packaged into different views (P’). The same sequence number should refer to the execution order, indicating which request is to be executed at the current time.</p><p>In the above scenario, the final state is indeed inconsistent due to node A’s failure.</p><h3 id="Two-Votes"><a href="#Two-Votes" class="headerlink" title="Two Votes"></a>Two Votes</h3><p>How does the two-vote process solve the problem in the above scenario?</p><ol><li>If node A fails after receiving the prepare result and before starting the commit, all nodes will not enter the execute phase.</li><li>If node A fails after receiving the commit result and before starting the execute, node A will retry executing P based on the commit result, then execute P’.</li></ol><h4 id="Scenario-Analysis-1"><a href="#Scenario-Analysis-1" class="headerlink" title="Scenario Analysis"></a>Scenario Analysis</h4><p>Did you notice a bit of unfairness in point 2?</p><p>In the two-vote scenario, node A can retry executing P based on the commit result.</p><p>In the single-vote scenario, node A does not retry executing P based on the commit result but directly executes P’.</p><p>Therefore, the two-vote process does not completely avoid state inconsistencies caused by node failures before execution. It merely adds an extra communication step to repeatedly confirm that other nodes’ states are consistent with its expectations, reducing the risk of state inconsistency.</p><p>The two-vote process advances the time for detecting faults. If node A does not cast a vote in the commit phase, other nodes will know that node A has failed, rather than waiting until they have executed and then discovering that node A has not executed. More confirmation means more security, reducing the cost of system rollback after execution and trying to agree as much as possible before execution. This is probably the greatest role of the two-vote process.</p><p>Overall, the second vote never seems to demonstrate an indispensable significance but merely brings some benefits and enhances system security. This issue might be similar to why TCP requires three-way handshakes to establish a connection. Wouldn’t two be enough? Perhaps even one is sufficient, but it could cause some problems. Three confirmations are sufficiently secure.</p><h3 id="Stateless-vs-Stateful"><a href="#Stateless-vs-Stateful" class="headerlink" title="Stateless vs. Stateful"></a>Stateless vs. Stateful</h3><p>Why does PBFT require repeated confirmations to avoid state inconsistencies after execution? Maybe because any system rollback is a very cautious task, so the cost of communication before execution is increased.</p><h4 id="Stateless"><a href="#Stateless" class="headerlink" title="Stateless"></a>Stateless</h4><p>Returning to the single-vote scenario above, under what circumstances would the faulty node A not execute P’?</p><ol><li>Node A knows it failed to execute P.</li><li>Node A must execute P before executing P’.</li></ol><p>If these two conditions are met, even with a single vote, the same effect as the two-vote process can be achieved.</p><p>For stateless systems, if a node only records a final number, it would be quite difficult. The node knows it has not executed P and then receives a P’, but cannot distinguish whether P’ should be executed after P or is on an equal level with P.</p><p>The normal sequence is:</p><pre><code>O -&gt; P -&gt; P&#39;</code></pre><p>For node A, knowing it has not executed P but receives a P’:</p><pre><code>O -&gt; (P&#39;)?</code></pre><p>Should it execute? Node A does, and the state becomes chaotic.</p><p>For this reason, the execution in stateless systems is very cautious.</p><h4 id="Stateful"><a href="#Stateful" class="headerlink" title="Stateful"></a>Stateful</h4><p>Blockchain is a stateful system that naturally records its execution records (blocks) and enforces the ordering of requests (block hash, parent hash).</p><p>When a node receives a block, it can determine the position of the block, whether it should be executed in the current round, and whether it is missing blocks, promptly synchronizing the blocks from other nodes.</p><p>Therefore, in the context of blockchain, if the goal is merely to achieve the final state consistency of most nodes, a second vote is not necessary.</p><h3 id="Doubts"><a href="#Doubts" class="headerlink" title="Doubts"></a>Doubts</h3><p>Why does PBFT require two votes? This question lies at the knowledge boundary of GPT-4. If you ask it in detail, it will start making up answers, which is typical of GPT-4 when it does not know the answer.</p><p>With my limited internet search capabilities, I have never found a convincing reason that proves the second vote in PBFT is necessary.</p><p>After repeated deductions, the conclusion I have reached is that a second vote is not necessary, and a single vote can also achieve the same majority node consistency.</p><p>But why, for so long, have PBFT and various variants such as Tendermint and HotStuff retained the two-vote process? Why has no one ever questioned the necessity of the second vote?</p><p>Where exactly am I wrong? Perhaps my understanding of PBFT is not deep enough, and I have not touched upon the scenarios where the second vote truly plays a role. But if such scenarios exist, why can’t I find material that directly describes these scenarios?</p>]]></content>

Some people use the fact that SOL has experienced several outages to prove that SOL’s technology is not good. Others say that trading coins is not technology-driven but capital-driven, and that technology is not important. These viewpoints reflect their respective positions.</p><p>From a developer’s perspective, no one would regard BNB as a blockchain because it is a platform coin, with centralized node operations and an operational model that is not blockchain-like. Technically, it forked Geth’s code with some modifications, and adopted PoS earlier than Geth to increase control over the entire chain. After ETH completes the Cancun upgrade, BNB also imitated and implemented its own BIP-4844, clearly belonging to the same technical system as ETH.</p><p>Another perspective is that after ETH’s ETF is close to approval, people start discussing whether the next ETF will be for DOGE, SOL, or even DOT, but no one mentions BNB, which fully demonstrates that BNB is different from other public chains and not in the same track. To determine whether two products belong to the same track, one can see if there is a competitive relationship where one must die for the other to live. If BNB uses ETH’s technology but hopes ETH dies, it is illogical. The normal logic should be hoping ETH gets better, and BNB will also benefit.</p><p>From a user’s (trader’s) perspective, it doesn’t matter what technology you use or how good your technology is. A meme can be in the top ten in market value, a dog with a hat can be worth billions, I will go where the investors are, I will buy what capital speculates, FOMO is the way to go.</p><p>The second case is when you say SOL’s technology is good, others will say ETH is better, so SOL is not good.</p><p>It’s the same issue of perspective. From a user’s point of view, there are countless reasons to compare the pros and cons of two projects. When you say A is good, someone can always find a B that is better than A or a C that is better than A in some aspect. Using such techniques, they can defeat anyone or any project. There is also a huge space for controversy and a hierarchy of disdain, just like whether PHP is the best language in the world.</p><p>But from a developer’s perspective, if I want to develop a chain, my chain needs to compare technology and compete for the market with SOL. Can I do better than SOL? Certainly not. So, from this standpoint, isn’t it reasonable for me to say SOL’s technology is pretty good?</p><p>SOL here is just an example. Actually, any established public chain in the top 100 of CMC has some highlights, especially those that pioneered and tried different consensus algorithms. They may not be as well-known as ETH and SOL, but they have also achieved good results.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, here are two additional tips about investing in cryptocurrencies:</p><ol><li><p>Whether you are using Bitcoin, fiat currency, or another cryptocurrency as your base, it mainly depends on what you have on hand and which currency is easily accessible. The logic of having no silver bullet applies in any situation.</p></li><li><p>With ETH’s ETF halfway approved, it implies that the SEC might accept PoS, but the ETF funds cannot be used for staking (I still don’t understand why). Previously, I mentioned selecting from the top 100 on CMC, and it might need another condition: the cryptocurrency should not have been labeled as a security by the SEC. Maybe after personnel changes or new laws pass, cryptocurrencies will no longer be under the SEC’s jurisdiction. However, at least it shows that under the same standards, many cryptocurrencies have obvious problems. ETH has always been in an ambiguous state, so its current situation with the ETF is quite complicated.</p></li></ol><p>There are actually only a handful of safe and reliable cryptocurrencies. For example, DOT has a low profile, and the SEC has never defined DOT, but its staking rate has reached 57% of its circulation, maintaining an annual yield of 17%. I still can’t understand what this situation implies, what the consequences of a high staking rate are, and why DOT’s yield can be so high. If all holders receive the annual yield equally, wouldn’t it be equivalent to inflation, causing the price to drop? For the network, the higher the staking rate, the safer it is. However, the fewer coins in circulation, the less useful the coin is, and it cannot even be used for transaction fees. Such incomprehensible cryptocurrencies are also not worth buying.</p><p>Now, about issuing cryptocurrencies. Recently, I inadvertently listened to a recording of Li Xiaolai that was circulating online, and it was quite enlightening.</p><p>The core point of all cryptocurrencies is just one: to distribute the coins in a valuable way. The price of the coin is determined by what the holders believe it is worth. As long as holders do not sell, the price will not fall. Including BTC, it is distributed through mining, every 10 minutes, a fixed amount regardless of how many participants, with one winner every 10 minutes, adding randomness and encouraging active participation.</p><p>ETH is also distributed through mining, with block rewards every 12 seconds given to miners, similar to BTC. ETH’s two major black marks are:</p><ol><li>The development team pre-mined an unknown amount, and the ICO distributed tokens at a low price to many people in a black-box manner.</li><li>The unlimited issuance model, with no cap on the total supply, potentially causing inflation and implying that the development team can print money continuously.</li></ol><p>Li Xiaolai issued a coin called Caddy, collaborating with a community of millions of real users, selling it to them at one-tenth the price and encouraging them to like, share, and hype news online. Li Xiaolai himself said that to successfully plan a coin, being an influencer with traffic and influence is a crucial condition. Li Xiaolai, being an influencer, frequently publishes books, gives speeches, and is a well-known teacher at New Oriental, has a strong background.</p><p>The point about being an influencer ultimately attracts a large number of fans, who recognize the coin, and the coin reaches these fans at a certain price. Therefore, whether it’s mining, early airdrops, exchange LaunchPools, or incentive distributions, the goal is to distribute the coins to holders in a valuable way. Holders must pay a price for the coin to have value. Giving it away broadly for free makes the coin worthless, but pegging it one-to-one with the dollar makes it a stablecoin. This value must be controlled, neither too specific nor non-existent.</p><p>Additionally, tenfold or hundredfold coins have no logic. ETH’s hype is generally attributed to two main reasons: one is a national policy at the time that prevented BTC from being withdrawn from exchanges. The other is a Ponzi scheme using ETH with a daily interest rate of 1%, where many users bought ETH from exchanges and transferred it to the Ponzi scheme, driving up the price. Interestingly, during this period, ETH’s price increased by over a thousand times, and the Ponzi scheme could sustain itself for three years without collapsing.</p><p>FIL was once heavily mined in China, with its price soaring to 200. Why was the price so high? It was also due to a Ponzi scheme. Later, mining was banned in China, and now FIL has no vitality left, despite its genuinely good technology. Another example is NEO, which also rose by hundreds of times without a good technical foundation, having only a dozen centralized nodes and being written in C#, claiming to be the Chinese version of Ethereum. The main reason for its rise was also a financial scheme. The founders didn’t hold many coins, and even now, it’s evident that the coin price is periodically manipulated by the scheme.</p><p>So, technology is not the absolute priority. Technology serves as a basis for horizontal comparison. For instance, among several projects called ETA, ETB, ETC, and ETH, even a Ponzi scheme would choose a relatively reliable coin with something to hype. Then it’s up to fate.</p><p>As for gossip, many news reports state that Li Xiaolai was once the richest person in the crypto world, buying six-figure amounts of Bitcoin at a quarter of the market price, holding it for years through multiple bull and bear cycles, and finally selling it at a high price. But it’s not that simple. You can find many of Li Xiaolai’s Bitcoin lectures online, showing that he did not just buy and hold but understood Bitcoin’s complex knowledge, gave lectures, and logically believed in Bitcoin before entering the crypto world. This teaches us not to buy blindly, but to look carefully before buying, not just buying a token with a nice code on the exchange or based on promotional articles. Those who genuinely make money have a deep logical foundation and do a lot of homework.</p><p>Another version of the gossip is that Li Xiaolai organized a Bitcoin fund, raising tens of thousands of Bitcoins for private investments in mining, exchanges, and stocks, which resulted in heavy losses, with many people losing money and forming a rights group. Later, he invested in EOS and made back the money, paying off the debts at a discount. Li Xiaolai boasted about having six-figure Bitcoins, but he didn’t. The police couldn’t find them during a search, and Li Xiaolai is still restricted from leaving the country. Who knows if he really has Bitcoins? If he does, he can’t be let out. This teaches us that no one gets rich by trading cryptocurrencies. Li Xiaolai was already wealthy, and despite that, he kept engaging in various operations, investing, and running funds. Making money always involves doing things, not expecting to get rich from trading cryptocurrencies by just buying and holding. Even those who participated in Li Xiaolai’s Bitcoin fund were skeptical about Bitcoin’s future value, with many dropping out along the way. So, what about now?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="1-BTC-is-the-Industry-Baseline"><a href="#1-BTC-is-the-Industry-Baseline" class="headerlink" title="1. BTC is the Industry Baseline"></a>1. BTC is the Industry Baseline</h3><p>The existence of Bitcoin underpins the entire cryptocurrency industry. If Bitcoin were ever to be discredited, deemed unsafe, not decentralized, or valueless, the whole industry would collapse. Bitcoin has never been surpassed. In fact, except for Bitcoin, all other cryptocurrencies are altcoins, especially in the eyes of veteran miners who have experienced the era of Bitcoin alone. Altcoins started as Bitcoin imitators, trying to make certain changes, including Ethereum. Vitalik also dabbled with colored coins, started chains from PoW, and raised funds in China. Everything started from Bitcoin.</p><h3 id="2-PoW-is-Resilient"><a href="#2-PoW-is-Resilient" class="headerlink" title="2. PoW is Resilient"></a>2. PoW is Resilient</h3><p>Around April 12, 2024, due to multiple factors, generally believed to be due to skirmishes between two countries potentially leading to war, all cryptocurrencies fell by an average of about 20%. Binance’s Gainer leaderboard was entirely red, which can be simply referred to as the 412 incident.</p><p>Observing the price changes during this period, it is evident that PoW-based coins generally fell less than PoS-based coins. Led by BTC, Doge, LTC, BCH, ZEC, ETC, and ETHW all showed smaller declines. After all, PoW chains involve miners investing real computational power and hardware costs, making them reluctant to sell at low prices. PoS, on the other hand, involves staking a lot of money into servers, generating money from money, which comes relatively easily. ETH, DOT, ADA, COSMOS, and many others—about 50 of the top 100 on CMC—are PoS-based with staking functions.</p><h3 id="3-BTC-Standard"><a href="#3-BTC-Standard" class="headerlink" title="3. BTC Standard"></a>3. BTC Standard</h3><p>The basic logic of crypto trading is based on the BTC standard, meaning trading altcoins against Bitcoin’s rate. Suppose you initially have 1 BTC and believe Doge’s upcoming rise will outperform BTC. You convert BTC to Doge, wait for Doge to rise by 20%, and then convert all Doge back to BTC. Your BTC has now increased from 1 to 1.2. This is the essence of the BTC standard.</p><p>From then on, you will ignore market fluctuations, undeterred by bull or bear markets, focusing only on the amount of Bitcoin you have—be it 1, 1.2, or 0.8. Regardless of how BTC’s price changes against fiat, it will double every four years, dropping before rising again, achieving all-time highs repeatedly.</p><p>Trading based on fiat standards usually ends in losses, with many suffering significant losses. This specifically refers to spot trading; avoid contracts entirely.</p><h3 id="4-Choose-from-CMC-Top-100"><a href="#4-Choose-from-CMC-Top-100" class="headerlink" title="4. Choose from CMC Top 100"></a>4. Choose from CMC Top 100</h3><p>Focus as much as possible on coins ranked in the top 100 on Coin Market Cap (CMC) and select from these. The reasons are twofold: the probability of a severe crash is lower, and support from the ecosystem is better. Lower-ranked coins can pose issues like wallet incompatibility, making transactions difficult. Or, a contract address change (as happened recently with an AI sector coin) can leave you stuck, as the old contract still runs at 20% of the price, while the new one operates at 80%.</p><h3 id="5-Founder’s-Departure-Marks-Decentralization"><a href="#5-Founder’s-Departure-Marks-Decentralization" class="headerlink" title="5. Founder’s Departure Marks Decentralization"></a>5. Founder’s Departure Marks Decentralization</h3><p>BTC is unique because its founder remained anonymous from the start, which was a very smart move. This anonymity allowed BTC to be widely speculated upon. Why are there so many asset types on BTC, like colored coins, RGB++, Taproot Assets, inscriptions, runes, and L2 assets still competing? Because no one can come forward to define a roadmap for Bitcoin, and no one knows how it should develop next.</p><p>In contrast, ETH’s founder actively participates in global conferences and gives talks, outlining Ethereum’s roadmap and guiding L2’s technological direction. When ETH was attacked by hackers, the founder led the community to fork away the attack history and transitioned the consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS. Such influence shows that ETH is centralized. ETH cannot pass the Howey test and is likely to be classified as a security under SEC standards.</p><p>If you created a coin and promoted it, it would seem inappropriate. However, if a coin is decentralized, you can promote it freely. You just like Doge, you can promote it as you wish.</p><p>BSV’s CW also lost a lawsuit this year. Some in the community see this as positive, believing CW’s departure signifies BSV becoming truly community-driven. Regardless of BSV’s future, the departure of the founder is a significant indicator.</p><p>Another example is ETC and ETHW. Both were forked by Baory, a controversial figure, but their market value, price, and TVL are notable. During the 412 incident, these two coins showed resilience. Although buying them is risky due to lack of technical updates and low GitHub activity, their prices remain intriguing. ETC and ETHW are truly without founders and are PoW coins.</p><p>Additionally, since Ethereum transitioned from PoW to PoS, the ETH&#x2F;BTC exchange rate has been declining, from nearly 0.1 to around 0.05 now.</p><h3 id="6-Others"><a href="#6-Others" class="headerlink" title="6.
