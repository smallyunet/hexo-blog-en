<p>Later, the children gradually grew up and reached the age to leave home. They walked out of the village, facing a bigger world.</p>
<p>Everyone went to the outside world. Some went far away from the village, while others stayed nearby.</p>
<p>They had magical stones that allowed them to keep in touch.</p>
<p>They would contact each other anytime, gossiping about the latest news and discussing the kingdom’s affairs.</p>
<p>On specific dates, they would return to the village to reunite and share updates.</p>
<p>Some worked in nearby towns, some studied in distant towns, and others remained in the village.</p>
<p>One person went very far.</p>
<p>He honed his body and mind at the academy, seeking skilled teachers to learn swordsmanship.</p>
<p>He trained his inner strength and refined his skills.</p>
<p>In the forest, he encountered kind rabbits and fierce wild boars.</p>
<p>He fought through thorns and brambles.</p>
<p>He proved his abilities to the governor and became an adventurer.</p>
<p>He held a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>When enemies invaded, he used the sword to slay them.</p>
<p>When facing robbers, he used the sword to protect himself.</p>
<p>More importantly, the sword carried a mission.</p>
<p>Not just the struggles at hand, but also the dragon on the mountain.</p>
<p>This sword was his weapon.</p>
<p>The dragon was his distant goal.</p>
<p>He walked on the road, looking down, thinking about the future.</p>
<p>One day, he returned home, back to the novice village.</p>
<p>He found that everyone was living well, in harmony.</p>
<p>Children with blond hair and pigtails.</p>
<p>Content and happy.</p>
<p>He saw that his friends had good relationships, coming and going.</p>
<p>Happy and pleased.</p>
<p>He thought about his own days and nights.</p>
<p>Thought about his own journeys through wind and rain.</p>
<p>Thought about the sword in his hand.</p>
<p>The only sword he had.</p>
<p>The day of departure came.</p>
<p>He looked back, seeing the peaceful lives.</p>
<p>Looked back, seeing the bustling market.</p>
<p>Looked back, hearing the laughter.</p>
<p>He looked forward.</p>
<p>Only vastness.</p>
<p>Behind him, no one was waiting.</p>
<p>Ahead, no one was waiting either.</p>
<p>He remembered, someone once was willing to wait for him. But he took up the sword and set off alone.</p>
<p>He departed.</p>
<p>He saw his close friends.</p>
<p>Saw the singing birds and fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Saw his childhood friends.</p>
<p>He turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>Paid no attention.</p>
<p>A friend waved.</p>
<p>Said nothing.</p>
<p>But he was moved.</p>
<p>He departed.</p>
<p>Where to go?</p>
<p>He thought about the mountains and rivers of the past.</p>
<p>Thought about the sun, moon, and stars of the future.</p>
<p>He liked this journey.</p>
<p>Also hated this journey.</p>
<p>He hesitated repeatedly.</p>
<p>Pondered over and over.</p>
<p>Tossed and turned.</p>
<p>Stayed up all night.</p>
<p>Racked his brains.</p>
<p>Tried every means.</p>
<p>Just wanted to ask that friend one question.</p>
<p>“Shall we go together?”</p>
<p>He might even stay.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to speak, he saw his friends happily playing mahjong.</p>
<p>Eating hotpot and singing songs.</p>
<p>No one needed him.</p>
<p>This journey.</p>
<p>No way back.</p>
<p>He liked the sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Also hated the sword in his hand.</p>
