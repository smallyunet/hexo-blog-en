A total of 15 companies interviewed, with 20 interview sessions in total.

### Initial Stage

- Optimized Day 1 (Thursday): Signed, packed, left.
- Optimized Day 2 (Friday): Cleared work-related code from the computer.
- Optimized Day 3 (Saturday): Looked for housing.
- Optimized Day 4 (Sunday): Moved houses.
- Optimized Day 5 (Monday): Finished the resume and started applying for jobs.

### Optimized Day 6 (Tuesday)

**Beijing Siwu IoT Technology Co., Ltd.**    
- Interview Type: On-site
- Interview Duration: 20 minutes
- Position: Solidity Contract Developer
- Company Business: Overseas-oriented DeFi product focusing on NFT staking, mimicking the AAVE protocol. The entire product avoids legal risks by not involving fiat currency transactions, using only tokens.
- Interview Conclusion: The direction does not match. They consider Filecoin an outdated technology, and my storage-related experience is more infrastructure-oriented, while they need someone specialized in DAPP application layer development.

**Zuiyou**
- Interview Type: Online video
- Interview Duration: 50 minutes
- Position: Blockchain Developer
- Company Business: Confidential innovative business, developed their own public chain.
- Interview Conclusion: They focused on BFT technical details and also discussed the implementation of Optimistic Rollup. From their focus on Tendermint consensus and Cosmos SDK usage, I guess it's a consortium chain business. The interviewer seemed to have a broader technical focus.

### Optimized Day 7 (Wednesday)

**Gate.io**    
- Interview Type: Online video
- Interview Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes
- Position: Golang Backend Developer
- Company Business: On-chain data analysis, data security, transaction data verification.
- Interview Conclusion: The direction does not match. My experience is more in chain development, whereas the position requires pure backend development. They tested my understanding of my work and posed a question on reversing a linked list. They were more concerned with web backend content, like the advantages of Node.js for backend services, the principles of TiDB, and differences between HTTP 3 and HTTP 2.

### Optimized Day 8 (Thursday)

**KuCoin**    
- Interview Type: Online video
- Interview Duration: 20 minutes
- Position: Blockchain Wallet Developer
- Company Business: Decentralized wallet.
- Interview Conclusion: The position requires someone proficient in Go language and preferably with blockchain knowledge. They asked about the signature algorithms used in blockchain, specifically ECC, and the purpose of the parameter 'v' in ECC, which I didn't know. Also asked how blockchain nodes select transactions when receiving many, which I also didn't know. Most questions were beyond my knowledge, thus not a good fit.

**Midaverse (Beijing) Network Technology Co., Ltd.**    
- Interview Type: Online audio
- Interview Duration: 20 minutes
- Position: Golang Backend Developer
- Company Business: GameFi backend involving ERC-721 NFT contracts.
- Interview Conclusion: Direction does not match. They asked a lot of language fundamentals, such as Go language escape analysis, controlling goroutine numbers at the CPU level, and whether anonymous classes in Java can inherit interfaces. Also asked about familiarity with ERC contract standards, which I didn't know. Backend roles seem to focus more on pure backend or language itself rather than blockchain knowledge.

### Optimized Day 9 (Friday)

**Lingjian Technology**    
- Interview Type: Online audio
- Interview Duration: 30 minutes
- Position: Blockchain Researcher, Blockchain Data Collector
- Company Business: MEV, quantitative trading.
- Interview Conclusion: Not a good match. They focused on EVM principles like storage structures, which I didn't know, and knowledge of DeFi projects due to their MEV projects. They also asked about deep and shallow copies in Python, which I couldn't answer.

**Lingjian Technology** (Second Time)
- Interview Type: Online test
- Test Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
- Test Instructions: Complete 4 basic computer technology questions within 2 hours.
- Question Source: <a href="MachineTest-LingjianTechnology.html">MachineTest-LingjianTechnology.html</a>
- Test Experience: Besides binary search being a bit tricky, other questions were too simple, making the test feel uninteresting.

### Optimized Day 10 (Saturday)

### Optimized Day 11 (Sunday)

**Midaverse (Beijing) Network Technology Co., Ltd.** (Second Time)
- Interview Type: Online audio
- Interview Duration: 30 minutes
- Interview Conclusion: The interviewer is the boss, who doesn't know much about blockchain. It's a small company without a dedicated blockchain technical person, and they mentioned needing someone to make chain selection decisions, which I had no interest in.

### Optimized Day 12 (Monday)

**Beijing Sihe Tiandi Technology Co., Ltd.**
- Interview Type: On-site
- Interview Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes
- Position: Blockchain Platform Developer
- Company Business: Developing a blockchain teaching platform for vocational colleges.
- Interview Conclusion: Four rounds of interviews: technical, technical lead, HR, and management. Their tech personnel don't understand blockchain, so questions were basic. They're currently forming a blockchain team, expected to have 2-3 people. The final interviewer was a sharp, gray-haired woman with a soft voice, fast speech, and frequent yawns, giving an oppressive aura. Despite their potential interest, I had no interest in their business.

### Optimized Day 13 (Tuesday)

**Pionex**
- Interview Type: Online video
- Interview Duration: 50 minutes
- Position: Data Collection Developer
- Company Business: NFT data tracking, cryptocurrency trading data tracking.
- Interview Conclusion: The HR was talkative, explaining the company background and business in detail before the interview. The interview was a normal chat with few questions.

### Optimized Day 14 (Wednesday)

Today I did three things:
1. Declined Sihe Tiandi's offer.
2. Spoke with imToken's HR for 40 minutes; they are not actively recruiting.
3. Spoke with an HR from another company and scheduled an interview for tomorrow.

### Optimized Day 15 (Thursday)

**Beijing Juan Yi Technology Co., Ltd.**
- Interview Type: Online video
- Interview Duration: 1 hour
- Position: Blockchain Developer
- Company Business: Layer 2.5
- Interview Conclusion: Technical first interview. This was my first time encountering a public chain development role and a company I wanted to join. However, the HR mentioned they needed senior developers who could mentor less experienced ones, so the outcome might not be favorable.

**Beijing Juan Yi Technology Co., Ltd.** (Second Time)

- Interview Conclusion: Technical second interview. Learned it's a startup team with seed funding, aiming to launch a Layer 2 project compatible with mainstream chains by the end of the year. The interviewer discussed their hiring philosophy, focusing on technical skills and team compatibility. I am interested in this company and project but did not elaborate during the technical interview.
