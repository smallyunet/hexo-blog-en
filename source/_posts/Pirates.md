Maybe the hero walked out of the maze  
He was a bit confused  
What is a hero?  
A heart of justice, protecting the homeland, slaying dragons, rescuing princesses  
And now the hero  
Stays home, struggles to survive, weary of life  
And  
No dragon destroys villages, no princess is kidnapped  
No homeland needs protection, no princess needs rescue  
  
Maybe the hero has seen dragons  
Some dragons are fierce and brutal, some dragons are kind and friendly  
They follow the laws of nature, survival of the fittest, bullying the weak  
They were never wrong  
  
However  
The world is still full of evil  
Poverty, hunger, war, chaos, suffering  
There are demons more terrifying than dragons  
They disguise themselves as humans  
Redeeming humans  
Destroying humans  
Becoming humans  
You can try to become a demon  
Or at least not become a demon  
  
As for the hero's later experiences  
It seems really unremarkable  
Nothing more than  
Swordsmanship, magic, attack, dodge  
Fighting monsters, leveling up, equipment, gold coins  
There were some small setbacks  
Maybe big setbacks  
Maybe  
It's the necessary path to becoming a hero  
  
Maybe  
The hero prefers the vast ocean  
Becoming a pirate  
Pursuing freedom, adventure, wealth  
Life is not always full of hope  
But pirates are often full of passion  
For ideals, or momentary pleasure  
  
Whether pursuing power, cruelty, domination  
Whether on a deserted island, in prison, in dire straits  
They always smile  
With elegant, rough, or embarrassing postures  
Facing failure  
  
This world is as you expect  
Tragic and exciting
