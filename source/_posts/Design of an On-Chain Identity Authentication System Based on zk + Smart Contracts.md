I named this system zkgate.fun, aiming to leverage the features of zero-knowledge proofs combined with blockchain to create a small utility.

The main function is to allow users to prove that they belong to a certain group, without revealing their real (on-chain) identity.

Here's the current design idea: the administrator first has a list of names, which can be an array of Ethereum addresses. Based on this address list, a Merkle Root Hash is computed.

Then, this root hash is submitted to a smart contract.

People included in this list can use a proving key from a Circom circuit to generate a zk proof for themselves, and then submit the zk proof to the smart contract.

On the smart contract side, the `verifier.sol` generated by the Circom circuit will be used to verify the received zk proof, determine whether the address used to generate the zk proof is included in the Merkle Root Hash, and finally return the result of the verification.

In this way, the administrator doesn't need to reveal which addresses are in the group, and addresses that belong to the group don't need to declare their identity. They just need to submit a zk proof generated by the zero-knowledge proof system to prove that they indeed belong to the group.

Next, I will proceed to implement this design from a technical perspective.
