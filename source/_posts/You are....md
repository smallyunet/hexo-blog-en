The flawed judicial system and incompetent police always remain indifferent. Your pregnant wife was killed by a juvenile criminal, and you watched as the criminal was released. The dirty judicial system, the incompetent investigative system. You personally punish those who should no longer exist in the world.

You are a dragon prince. Your grandfather, the chief of the gods, was killed due to rebellion from other tribes. Was it really a rebellion? No!

You are the ruler of a dynasty. The princess of the bird deity tribe abandoned you. After years of war, you meet a girl who resembles the princess, and you vaguely see her as your dream lover. Years later, you discover the princess's consciousness remains in your wound; she never forgot you and always cared for you, but she could not betray her race.
