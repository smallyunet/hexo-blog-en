The hero was injured.

He came to the foot of the mountain and found that monsters blocked his way up.

The monster's name was Authority.

He made a deal with the monster, giving up all his previous medals and honors.

He threw away his sword, discarded his armor, and killed his horse.

He could go up the mountain now, but he didn't.

He needed a new sword.

He went to the nearby magic town, went to the distant treasure mountain.

Went to the best weapon shop, went to the mysterious pirate bay.

A vulture pecked his shoulder, a porcupine blocked his way.

The guard made things difficult for him because of his plain clothes, the judge questioned his lack of talent.

He was tired.

He went back to the inn where he was staying and thought of the past.

He needed to go home.

He wanted to rest.

He even wanted to give up.

He returned to the novice village and met his friends.

He was a triumphant adventurer, he was a fearless warrior.

He had shining armor, he had a proud white horse.

He was no longer a novice, and had no more friends.

He could not fall, nor could he be afraid.

Although he was tired.

One house, lived in for 351 days a year, another house, lived in for 14 days a year.

Which one is home, which one is the inn.

One place, spent 351 days a year, another place, spent 14 days a year.

Where is life, where is the journey.

He returned to the inn, everything started anew, everything remained the same.

He ultimately did not find the sword.

If you see him,

He might be confused,

Or he might be wandering.

Please tell him,

He can keep moving forward,

Or he can take a short break,

Or he can take a few steps back,

He can write a magic book,

He might master advanced spells,

He will become an excellent mage,

And not just a sword-wielding warrior.
