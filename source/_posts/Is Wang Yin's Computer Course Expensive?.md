### The Rarity of the Course

Imagine this: you don’t want to take [Wang Yin's course](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2025/05/12/cs-video-course), but you still want to master the knowledge it offers—what are your options?

For the same amount of money, you can't buy it anywhere else. Are there other Chinese-speaking individuals in the world with Wang Yin’s academic background, who have also spent years refining a high-quality course like this through teaching experiments? A course of this caliber is priceless, even if there's a market for it.

Sure, you could pursue this knowledge on your own—first becoming fluent in English, then getting accepted into a top-tier U.S. university for a master’s degree. After years of studying abroad, you would not only spend a lot of money but also invest significant time, energy, and effort—not to mention needing some talent and luck—to attain knowledge at the same level as Wang Yin’s course. The cost you pay is far beyond just money.

Do you still think Wang Yin’s course is expensive?

### Course Content

I just described Wang Yin’s course as being “of this level”—so what exactly does that mean? Let me give you a specific example.

Lesson 1 is about functions. Right? Every programmer knows what a function is. Even if you're not a programmer, you’ve probably encountered functions in middle school math.

Before taking the course, what is a function? A function is one of the syntactic elements of a programming language—used to wrap multiple lines of code for easier reuse. In object-oriented terms, it’s called “encapsulation.” Functions are a basic concept.

After taking the course, what is a function? A function can be a fundamental unit of computation. A function can be an input to a computation, or it can be an output. The output of one computation can become the input of another. Functions that are output can be invoked by other functions...

You're probably not quite following what I mean.

Let me explain from a different angle: Wang Yin’s mentor, [Daniel P. Friedman](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2012/07/04/dan-friedman), published a book called [*The Little Learner*](https://www.thelittlelearner.com/). In the preface, Guy L. Steele Jr. wrote that Friedman uses four different applications of higher-order functions in this book to illustrate the core principles of machine learning.

Don’t believe that functions can express the principles of deep learning? Then look into lambda calculus—a formal system on par with the Turing machine. It can express the entire computational framework, not just deep learning.

That is what a “function” really is. The function in Lesson 1 refers to this kind of function.
