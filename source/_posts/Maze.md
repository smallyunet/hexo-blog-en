The hero had a dream  
He lived in distant fields  
No armor, no sword  
Parents by his side, family healthy  
No bustling city, no magic  
Friends calling, gathering in groups  
No dreams, no faraway places  
Every day was laborious, hard and plain  
No monsters, no evil dragons  
A warm home and a gentle her  
Someone asked, what is happiness?  
He said, as soon as the bell rings, you know who the letter is from  
It must be her  

The hero woke up in the twilight cave  
Feeling confused about the life in his dream  
Clearly it was peaceful and harmonious happiness  
Yet it made one feel filled with despair  
How much colorful prayer has been buried  
By the monotonous and boring routine  
In front of him were tall trees and rugged roads  
Unrecognizable directions, unspeakable bitterness  
The sun rises and sets, over and over  
Endlessly, always the same lost path  
Someone asked, what is loneliness?  
He said, as soon as the bell rings, you know who the letter is from  
Only her  

He returned to the place without dreams  
But suddenly couldn't tell where the dream was  

At that time  
He met a passing priest, things started from there  
He threw away his old magic book to seek more treasures  
He began to think the journey might not be a solo one  
The dangers and torments he faced before were his own trials  
With the priest's healing and blessings, everything became easier  

However  
There are no unexpected surprises in the world  
Maybe it's not just a game  
But ultimately, it's just a passerby  
The mutual support in the short time together  
Is enough to piece together future memories  
When time flows to a point where it can't stop  
He can still write an unmonotonous history  

Therefore  
Many times he wanted to give up  
But whenever he turned to leave  
He saw her expression  
It's the feeling he couldn't let go  

This is a game that can't be broken  
Once trapped in it, you lose completely  

At this moment  
The town is not peaceful inside and out  
The distant country is ravaged by war  
The residents within the walls are like puppets  
The walking dead can still unite against the enemy  
Better than the wine sacks and rice bags trapped in their own cocoons  
Demons from hell hold up signs  
Randomly altering the imagined kingdom  
Destroying the established order and mindset  

He couldn't change anything  
He wasn't the only hero  
Nor the only failure  
No extraordinary talent  
No divine prophecy from the heavens  
Just an unsurprising play  

The play is still on  
The stage hasn't scattered  
The audience is still watching
