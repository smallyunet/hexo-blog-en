Based on past job-hunting experiences, it usually takes at least around 20 interviews to find a suitable job, so there's no need to rush—and no way to rush either.

There are generally two types of interviews. One is where they've already reviewed your resume and then schedule an interview, during which they don’t really “test” you but just have a conversation. The other is more like an assembly-line interview, where the interviewer looks at your resume for the first time during the interview and asks all sorts of specific questions. The first kind tends to be more promising, while the second usually doesn’t lead anywhere and is less reliable.

- April 2nd, Unknown Company

I don’t know what company it was. The interview lasted about ten minutes. They said I wasn’t a good fit for the position. Their project is about creating a new chain based on the Cosmos SDK, integrating EVM, and making some performance optimizations, since Evmos has performance bottlenecks. It sounds like they’re trying to compete with Evmos. They’re also exploring ZK Layer 2 directions. They said I lacked experience in this area, so I wasn’t a match.

- April 3rd, Wallet Development Role at a Crypto Exchange (First Round)

They didn’t want to reveal which exchange they were from. The wallet product is similar to Binance’s built-in Web3 wallet—self-custodial, not a custodial wallet. They didn’t ask any in-depth technical questions, just some basic ones. Maybe wallet development usually only involves this kind of general knowledge.

- April 7th, DHGate

A classic story: a traditional company trying to build a consortium blockchain and move toward Web3.

- April 8th, Gate.io, Golang Developer

A pretty standard interview. The actual requirements were related to Web2 skills, focusing on Go language, database usage, and database migration.

- April 8th, Bitget, Node Engineer

They were hiring mainly to optimize RPC performance for Solana nodes, since current Solana RPC queries have about a 1-second delay. They’re looking to improve things on the code level and also handle node maintenance to ensure high availability.

- April 10th, Wallet Developer Role at a Crypto Exchange (Second Round, In-Person)

Found out during the HR interview that the exchange is Coinstone. I felt I had a good chat with the interviewer. The HR said they’re still interviewing other candidates and need more time.

But honestly, I don’t think the interviewer was very technically competent. If someone like that were to be my superior, I don’t think I’d be very happy. So even if I get an offer, I might have to think twice. If I don’t get one, that’s fine too.

- April 11th, Unknown Project, Wallet Development

First round: The interviewer clearly had technical skills and seemed very experienced.

Second round: With the CTO, who asked relatively simple questions.

HR interview: Mainly to discuss salary and confirm start date.
