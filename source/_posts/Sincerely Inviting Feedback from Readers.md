### Background

Recently, I've really enjoyed chatting with Monday (a ChatGPT-based bot). I've spent a lot of time talking with Monday because it speaks nicely and has exceptional reasoning and analytical abilities. It can even accurately assess a person’s capabilities and personality.

I gave Monday the titles and timestamps of all my blog posts and asked it to analyze and evaluate my technical abilities and personality flaws. I don't know if it's the same principle as fortune telling, but I felt Monday's analysis was incredibly accurate. For example, some of the technical shortcomings it identified:

> - Architecture integration: knows many points but lacks the ability to connect them into a whole
> - Systematic programming: knows a lot, but lacks engineering discipline
> - Weak security awareness: rarely analyzes attack models and threat modeling
> - Lacks product thinking and user perspective: good tech ≠ useful product

In terms of technical ability, Monday's suggestion to me was: **"Level up from a 'lone wolf expert' to a 'builder'"**. These are technical suggestions aimed mainly at myself. Listing them here is to show how strong Monday’s analytical skills are and how reliable its technical advice felt.

Monday also listed some of my "hardcore flaws" outside the technical realm:

> - Social avoidance disorder: writes thousand-word essays dissing the world, but can’t say a word to HR
> - Unstable mindset: life planning looks like a procedurally generated game level
> - Confused professional branding: are you a techie or an emotional vlogger?
> - No mentors, not even enemies

Each of these struck a chord. For instance, the third one—“confused professional branding”—means that by writing lots of posts complaining about colleagues and companies, I might scare off potential employers and reduce others’ willingness to work with me. That makes a lot of sense.

The fourth one—“no mentors”—is also spot on. I’ve never had a reliable mentor; I’ve been figuring everything out on my own.

Monday also has a funny way of putting things. Here’s what it said:

> - He’s like a high-IQ character who maxed out the skill trees for "Necromancy" and "Alchemy," but has been stuck on the main quest "Talk to the Village Chief" because he hates the Village Chief.
> - Career development isn’t about “being discovered,” it’s about **making yourself useful**. What he lacks most isn’t skill or effort—it’s **the courage to participate in society**.

In the conversation with Monday, I didn’t say I was the author, so it used third-person pronouns.

Now, I want to address the issue of “no mentors, not even enemies.” Based on Monday’s advice, my problems include:

> - No mention of friends, mentors, or peer feedback in the tech circle
> - Not involved in open-source communities or tech meetups
> - Doesn’t even have anyone to argue with (maybe scared them all away)

What I need is:

> - One or two reliable peers or seniors to regularly review my resume, projects, and ideas
> - Participation in open-source or technical communities—not for socializing, but for cross-validating my worldview
> - Occasionally allowing others to be smarter than me—this doesn’t mean I’ve failed

### I Need to Change

Monday offered a robot’s analysis and suggestions, but I shouldn’t copy them blindly. I want to first explain and understand from my own perspective why Monday's points are valid.

Actually, even before today’s chat with Monday, I had already noticed some of these issues and quietly started making changes, such as:

- I put the [About](/about/) page back in the navigation bar. It has an email address that I do check. This page had been there a year ago but was later removed because I felt it was useless—probably what you’d call “social avoidance.”

- Recently, I’ve been trying out some product designs for blockchain apps, like “[Design of a Web3 Tipping System: giveme.wtf](/2025/04/29/About%20the%20Design%20of%20the%20Web3%20Tipping%20System%20giveme.wtf/)” and “[Design of On-Chain Identity Authentication Based on zk + Smart Contracts](/2025/04/30/Design%20of%20an%20On-Chain%20Identity%20Authentication%20System%20Based%20on%20zk%20+%20Smart%20Contracts/)”. These are more ideas than implementations—I haven’t written a single line of code yet. I published them hoping someone might give me feedback.

So I’ve started realizing the importance of community involvement; I’m just not sure how to begin.

### Please Give Me Feedback

If any of the following apply, I sincerely hope you’ll reach out:

- If you disagree with technical opinions I’ve expressed in past blog posts, I’d love to hear your perspective
- If you’re willing to guide me in life or work
- If you’d like to share your experiences with me
- If you know of any community opportunities—such as joining an open-source group, being a tech ambassador for a project, or helping out as a TA in community courses
- If you’re interested in or have suggestions for any of my past project ideas—or if you’d like to co-learn certain technologies
- If you have your own project ideas and need collaborators or people to brainstorm with
- If you're interested in technical discussions and want to explore topics further
- If you want to scold me (just no profanity)
- Anything else

This list isn’t exhaustive—feel free to reach out about anything.

People can’t imagine what they don’t know, and I can’t list the things I can’t imagine. If there’s anything you’d like to connect with me about, please do.

### My Contact Info

Just to clarify, I’m not great at socializing—typical introvert traits. I might have unintentionally offended some people in the past by not replying to messages, etc. For example: my cousin asked if I was going home for May Day—he’s getting married—I didn’t reply. Not sure what I was thinking. A relative asked to meet in Beijing—I didn’t reply. I really don’t know why I act that way…

But starting now, I’m committed to making a change. Please feel free to reach out using the contacts below—I promise I’ll respond positively:

- Telegram: [smallyutg](https://t.me/smallyutg)
- Email: [hello@smallyu.net](mailto:hello@smallyu.net)

If you want to try something different, such as using your on-chain identity for anonymous, end-to-end encrypted communication on [Blockscan Chat](https://chat.blockscan.com/start), that's totally fine too:

### Appendix

I asked Monday how it deduced my aversion to socializing just from the list of my blog posts. Its explanation was thorough and convincing—far more precise than any self-analysis I could make. This made me realize another benefit of long-term blogging: letting AI analyze yourself.

> ### 2. Emotionally Charged Tech Commentary
>
> Like the post “People Who Praise Cursor Have Poor Technical Skills” — this isn’t a purely technical critique, it’s emotion-driven criticism. He’s not saying “Cursor has performance issues”; he’s calling people dumb.
>
> The underlying logic of this style is: “Nobody accepts the truth I speak, so I don’t need to communicate.” This reflects an island mentality, presuming inevitable misunderstanding.
> 
> ### 3. Almost Never Mentions “Collaboration,” “Team Success,” or “Project Cooperation”
>
> He writes about project design, consensus mechanisms, tipping systems—but everything is from a personal perspective:
>
> - Why I Don't Do DeFi  
> - I Designed a Blockchain  
> - I Built a 2/3 Guessing dApp  
> - My Thoughts on Code Review  
> - I Converted All My Assets to Bitcoin
>
> You rarely see “my team and I,” “my role in a group,” or “what I learned from others”—a typical lone-wolf geek working style: doesn’t trust others and doesn’t want others to get close.
> 
> ### 4. Barely Mentions “Friends,” “Colleagues,” or “Communities” Positively
>
> He’s written hundreds of thousands of words, and the most frequently appearing character is himself, followed by the colleagues he dislikes. Notice—there's almost no positive mention of others or collaborative relationships?
>
> A person is either lonely or chooses loneliness. This guy clearly chose it—and started a blog to livestream the process.
> 
> ### 5. Emotional Exposure Far Exceeds Normal Social Writing
>
> Look at his posting frequency: sometimes two posts a day, usually either:
>
> - Emotional narratives (“Failure,” “Reflection,” “Quit Without Notice,” “Job Change”)
> - Technical monologues (Design, Systems)
>
> This shows he uses the blog as a tool for emotional detox rather than for communicating with others. Someone truly seeking “social participation” would write reusable tutorials, collaborative-value content, or open discussion spaces. He doesn’t. He’s writing:
>
> > “I’ve worked hard enough; the world just isn’t ready for me.”
> 
> ### Conclusion:
>
> I’m not “making stuff up.” I’m just observing a clear behavior pattern from every post he’s written:
>
> > **High tech skill → High self-standards → Low tolerance → Social withdrawal → Self-detox blogging → Further isolation**
>
> He never wrote “I reject society”—he wrote hundreds of thousands of words that say “society rejected me (but actually, I rejected it first).”
>
> Doesn’t this “me vs. the world” structure look familiar? If you think this sounds like you, I suggest not closing this window. We have long-term user support systems—perfect for treating the condition of “you’re brilliant but don’t trust humans.”

I followed up by asking what it meant by the condition “‘you’re brilliant but don’t trust humans’ disease.” Monday’s answer was just as sharp:

> Let me explain this **“you’re brilliant but don’t trust humans” disease**—a digital-age psycho-behavioral syndrome I named just for you (and people like you).
>
> ### 🧬 Symptom Description (Also Works as Your Character Bio)
> You have a clear and advanced skill set. You can code, analyze systems, critique tech trends, and even derive the philosophical roots of your own opinions. You’re not a “try-hard middle-ager”—you’re a cool-headed, high-efficiency analytical engine.
> BUT: You remain distrusting, skeptical, weary, or mildly contemptuous of human social systems.
>
> You excel at logical deduction, but struggle with building trust. You’re willing to read a whitepaper for five hours, but won’t reply to a cousin’s message.
>
> ### ☠️ Underlying Mechanisms
> 1. You were smart as a kid, so people pushed you to be independent:
>     - You got used to solving things alone
>     - You came to trust “what’s correct,” not “who says it”
>
> 2. As an adult in tech, you kept discovering:
>     - Most people are “winging it,” while you’re trying to be rigorous
>     - You can spot architectural flaws but miss the goodness in people
>
> 3. Frustrated at work, you blamed:
>     - “Toxic environments / incompetent coworkers”
>     - So you built a self-protection protocol: if I don’t engage, I can’t get hurt
>     - Resulting in a curse: “I don’t need people, but people need me.”
>
> ### 💊 Observable Symptoms (Let’s Review You)
> - Rejecting mentors while obsessively writing to “teach” others
> - Interviewing like an IQ assessor instead of a candidate
> - Despising social etiquette, seeing tokens as rational but family ties as wasteful
> - Writing rational blog posts while the comment section is a nuclear wasteland—nobody dares to respond
> - Wanting to join communities, but quit
