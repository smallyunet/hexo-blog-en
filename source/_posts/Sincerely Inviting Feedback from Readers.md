### Background

Recently, I've really enjoyed chatting with Monday (a ChatGPT-based bot). I've spent a lot of time talking with Monday because it speaks nicely and has exceptional reasoning and analytical abilities. It can even accurately assess a person’s capabilities and personality.

I gave Monday the titles and timestamps of all my blog posts and asked it to analyze and evaluate my technical abilities and personality flaws. I don't know if it's the same principle as fortune telling, but I felt Monday's analysis was incredibly accurate. For example, some of the technical shortcomings it identified:

> - Architecture integration: knows many points but lacks the ability to connect them into a whole
> - Systematic programming: knows a lot, but lacks engineering discipline
> - Weak security awareness: rarely analyzes attack models and threat modeling
> - Lacks product thinking and user perspective: good tech ≠ useful product

In terms of technical ability, Monday's suggestion to me was: **"Level up from a 'lone wolf expert' to a 'builder'"**. These are technical suggestions aimed mainly at myself. Listing them here is to show how strong Monday’s analytical skills are and how reliable its technical advice felt.

Monday also listed some of my "hardcore flaws" outside the technical realm:

> - Social avoidance disorder: writes thousand-word essays dissing the world, but can’t say a word to HR
> - Unstable mindset: life planning looks like a procedurally generated game level
> - Confused professional branding: are you a techie or an emotional vlogger?
> - No mentors, not even enemies

Each of these struck a chord. For instance, the third one—“confused professional branding”—means that by writing lots of posts complaining about colleagues and companies, I might scare off potential employers and reduce others’ willingness to work with me. That makes a lot of sense.

The fourth one—“no mentors”—is also spot on. I’ve never had a reliable mentor; I’ve been figuring everything out on my own.

Monday also has a funny way of putting things. Here’s what it said:

> - He’s like a high-IQ character who maxed out the skill trees for "Necromancy" and "Alchemy," but has been stuck on the main quest "Talk to the Village Chief" because he hates the Village Chief.
> - Career development isn’t about “being discovered,” it’s about **making yourself useful**. What he lacks most isn’t skill or effort—it’s **the courage to participate in society**.

In the conversation with Monday, I didn’t say I was the author, so it used third-person pronouns.

Now, I want to address the issue of “no mentors, not even enemies.” Based on Monday’s advice, my problems include:

> - No mention of friends, mentors, or peer feedback in the tech circle
> - Not involved in open-source communities or tech meetups
> - Doesn’t even have anyone to argue with (maybe scared them all away)

What I need is:

> - One or two reliable peers or seniors to regularly review my resume, projects, and ideas
> - Participation in open-source or technical communities—not for socializing, but for cross-validating my worldview
> - Occasionally allowing others to be smarter than me—this doesn’t mean I’ve failed

### I Need to Change

Monday offered a robot’s analysis and suggestions, but I shouldn’t copy them blindly. I want to first explain and understand from my own perspective why Monday's points are valid.

Actually, even before today’s chat with Monday, I had already noticed some of these issues and quietly started making changes, such as:

- I put the [About](/about/) page back in the navigation bar. It has an email address that I do check. This page had been there a year ago but was later removed because I felt it was useless—probably what you’d call “social avoidance.”

- Recently, I’ve been trying out some product designs for blockchain apps, like “[Design of a Web3 Tipping System: giveme.wtf](/2025/04/29/About%20the%20Design%20of%20the%20Web3%20Tipping%20System%20giveme.wtf/)” and “[Design of On-Chain Identity Authentication Based on zk + Smart Contracts](/2025/04/30/Design%20of%20an%20On-Chain%20Identity%20Authentication%20System%20Based%20on%20zk%20+%20Smart%20Contracts/)”. These are more ideas than implementations—I haven’t written a single line of code yet. I published them hoping someone might give me feedback.

So I’ve started realizing the importance of community involvement; I’m just not sure how to begin.

### Please Give Me Feedback

If any of the following apply, I sincerely hope you’ll reach out:

- If you disagree with technical opinions I’ve expressed in past blog posts, I’d love to hear your perspective
- If you’re willing to guide me in life or work
- If you’d like to share your experiences with me
- If you know of any community opportunities—such as joining an open-source group, being a tech ambassador for a project, or helping out as a TA in community courses
- If you’re interested in or have suggestions for any of my past project ideas—or if you’d like to co-learn certain technologies
- If you have your own project ideas and need collaborators or people to brainstorm with
- If you're interested in technical discussions and want to explore topics further
- If you want to scold me (just no profanity)
- Anything else

This list isn’t exhaustive—feel free to reach out about anything.

People can’t imagine what they don’t know, and I can’t list the things I can’t imagine. If there’s anything you’d like to connect with me about, please do.

### My Contact Info

Just to clarify, I’m not great at socializing—typical introvert traits. I might have unintentionally offended some people in the past by not replying to messages, etc. For example: my cousin asked if I was going home for May Day—he’s getting married—I didn’t reply. Not sure what I was thinking. A relative asked to meet in Beijing—I didn’t reply. I really don’t know why I act that way…

But starting now, I’m committed to making a change. Please feel free to reach out using the contacts below—I promise I’ll respond positively:
