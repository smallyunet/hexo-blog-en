I could have many reasons to be happy, but I always let some unnecessary goals trouble me.

I have no reason to give up my career and technical interests because of unrelated people and things at work.

I don't want to spend time caring about issues I don't need to care about. There are many things I am interested in that I haven't done yet.

Why don't I prioritize my own matters?
