Analogous to TDD (Test-driven development), here I propose the concept of PDL (Problem-driven learning).

This concept seems easy to understand, but I am unable to fully elaborate on it at the moment and will gradually improve it later. This learning method is effective for people with a certain foundation, and it is not yet determined whether it can be extended to people without any foundation.
