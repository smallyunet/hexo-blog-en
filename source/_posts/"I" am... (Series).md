"I" am a person with a cleanliness obsession.

The wealthy merchants living in villas all have a cleanliness obsession. Their cabinets are filled with gold and silver jewelry, which they carefully dust and arrange, keeping everything neat, orderly, and spotless.

I see the dignitaries in their palatial residences doing the same.

Although I only have a trash can in front of me, filled with dirty, discarded items, I can't stand its disarray. I must make it clean and tidy because I have a cleanliness obsession.

When I see someone carelessly throwing garbage into the trash can and ignoring it, I loudly complain and even reprimand them, even though they show no remorse.

Why don't they understand cleanliness and order? Why can't they be like me, like the dignitaries, strict with themselves, with a cleanliness obsession, loving cleanliness and order?

I have a cleanliness obsession. I am nobler than those who don't understand cleanliness and order. I am superior to them. (dog head)

"I" am a designer.

I have defined a new rule of addition, under which 1+1=3, and 2+2=5.

I came up with some questions, such as 3+3=? and 4+4=?. If someone can answer these questions, it shows they have mastered the "knowledge" I created.

Some people are passionate about learning the knowledge I created, worshiping me as a deity, tirelessly and proudly doing so, even looking down on those who haven't mastered this knowledge.

Some people even argue heatedly, discussing whether the knowledge I created is better than that created by another designer.

Some people feel that mastering the knowledge I created makes them superior to those who have mastered another designer's knowledge.

I like these interesting people, though in my eyes, they are all just bugs. (dog head)

"I" am an architect, able to draw design plans for ordinary buildings.

One time, a foreman asked me to help on the construction site because they were short-handed and needed to move bricks from one place to another. I went.

The brick movers didn't understand why, when moving the same bricks from the same place to the same place, my pay was higher than theirs.

"I" am Ultraman.

Humans always "kindly" advise me that monsters are very powerful and strong, that they have destroyed many human houses and lands, brought death and fear to many human warriors, and that I should be careful of the monsters' attacks, respect the monsters, and not underestimate them.

I can't be bothered to explain that I can shoot lasers just by raising my hand.

"I" am a captain.

I ordered my crew to search for treasure on a small island. The treasure must be there.

If you insist on asking why I am sure there is treasure on that island, it's because other ships have gone there to search, and they are doing so very enthusiastically and on a grand scale.

Even if some crew members who have explored the island say there is nothing there.

Even if crew members who have been to larger islands say there is nothing there.

The treasure must be there.

If you insist on asking why I am sure there is treasure on that island, it's because other ships have gone there to search, and they are doing so very enthusiastically and on a grand scale.

"I" am a senior player of a game.

I often talk about how fun this game is, why it's fun, why it's worth playing, and how promising it is.

We often discuss the gameplay, factions, strategies, upgrades, achievements, equipment, guilds, quests, operations, and more.

A novice player said this game is not fun.

A novice player said that although this game is fun, it's not as fun as another game, not as valuable, not as promising, not as meaningful as another game.

How could I abandon the accumulation I've made in this game to play another game I've never played before?

I wouldn't even admit that the novice player might be right.

Even if the novice player is indeed right.

"I" am a landlord.

Autumn has arrived, and the family needs to hire workers to harvest the wheat in the fields, both long-term and short-term workers.

I often see the workers discussing harvesting techniques, comparing who is faster, whose quality is higher, who has more experience and can quickly harvest all kinds of unevenly grown wheat.

The more skilled, articulate, and loyal workers, I naturally like more. They also take pride in this because they receive more recognition and pay than other workers.

Skilled workers have a sense of superiority. They can go to any landlord's house to harvest wheat because they have excellent harvesting skills. Most landlords have no reason to refuse such workers. This is not a treatment that ordinary workers can enjoy; they are already considered advanced workers.

Advanced workers sometimes even teach ordinary workers harvesting techniques and share tips. When the landlord hires new workers, he will also let the advanced workers handle it, using tricky technical questions to determine whether the prospective workers can meet the landlord's requirements.
