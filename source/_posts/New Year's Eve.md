The pile of packages in the corner has been left unopened for a long time  
The quilt I wanted to replace has not been bought yet

The murder mystery games are not as lively as before  
Weekday players are not as immersed as before  
The game proceeds as usual countless times  
New stories, new scripts, new stores  
But in my mind, only past scenes come to mind  

Open-source projects remain stagnant as usual  
Nothing specifically needs to be done during the Spring Festival  
I always want to avoid wasting time and life  
But self-improvement has become a part of daily life  

Playing games that I'm not interested in to kill time  
But I worry if time can really be used for leisure  
However, if I don't consume time, what else can I do  

Some people start families at a young age  
Some are still single even at an older age  
At the same age, some are forced to grow up  
At the same age, some don't want to take responsibility  

The vehicles on the street are not as bustling as before  
On New Year's Eve, I especially don't want to go out  
I want to experience the troubles alone  
Mainly because there's nothing to do outside  

The roommate reminds me to lock the doors and windows  
But the kindness from hometown catches me off guard  
Under the prosperity and beauty of this great era  
How many struggling cattle and horses are concealed  

The scenery outside the window has been seen many times  
The wind and clouds change  
Constant and unchanging  

Maybe my writing skills have declined  
Recently, there have indeed been many things without a clue  
Too many things are unclear about the outcome  
But at least I will always be here
