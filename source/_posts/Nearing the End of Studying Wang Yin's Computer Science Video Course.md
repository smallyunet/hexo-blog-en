Recently, I enrolled in Mr. Wang Yin's [Computer Science Video Course](https://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2025/05/12/cs-video-course) (Foundation Level), and now I'm nearing the end of the learning process. Since the final class is an elective, I chose Rust. However, because learning Rust itself has a steep learning curve, I don’t think I can grasp and complete it as quickly as the previous classes. But Rust is an optional advanced topic for me, so I'm not in a rush to finish.

Previous iterations of the foundation course didn’t even have a seventh or eighth class, so the content of the last two classes doesn’t affect the course's value—they're more like bonus content. I’ve completed the first seven lessons and gained a lot from them. My overall impression of the foundation course is that it's worth far more than its cost.

### Follow-up Study Plans for the Course

Here are some follow-up study plans I’ve outlined for the foundation course content:

1. Write a simple parser for the interpreter implemented in the course
2. Redo all the exercises
3. Reproduce Mr. Wang Yin’s teaching approach and write out all the course code myself
4. Understand the motivations behind the exercises and come up with new ones
5. Implement the course interpreter using the Go language

These goals increase in difficulty, and realizing them will require a lot of time. So even though the foundation course is ending, the learning of its content is far from over. The foundation course is a fantastic starting point; the knowledge gained can lead to many valuable extensions, which might be even more valuable than the course itself.

The foundation course knowledge is like a high-grade raw material—graduating means obtaining this raw material. But raw materials need to be refined, forged, and processed repeatedly to become practical tools. I guess that's why some students feel they gained nothing after finishing, while others feel they've received a treasure trove they can use repeatedly to generate value.

### Reflection on Career Reflection

I began reflecting on my career path in April when I joined a new company, working on backend development for a regular wallet product.

During the actual work, I found that some colleagues wrote poor code inefficiently, had weak overall engineering skills, yet always appeared extremely busy. The leadership still entrusted them with important tasks because they knew each other beforehand.

This made me very uncomfortable. I know blockchain well, but this knowledge hasn’t made my career any easier or improved my life. Instead, I was treated like a newbie in my new job.

Similarly, despite my strong engineering skills and high work efficiency—being able to quickly turn technical designs into working code—I was disrespected by colleagues at my previous company.

So I started reflecting: is it because my technical skills aren't strong enough? Because I didn’t attend a top school? Is it due to the industry environment or my past career choices?

This reflection resulted in the frequent blog updates in April, my attempts to design technical products, learn new technologies, and change my approach to social interactions. It turns out that if I want to, I *can* learn ZK or do some EVM-related work. But that’s still not enough—I should apply this learning and engineering ability to more valuable areas.

### Reflection on Blog Content

I used to freely share the technologies I learned, career experiences, and industry insights on my blog. Since much of the content was self-explored and my views formed through learning and thinking, I didn’t mind sharing them.

But opinions and knowledge are different. The knowledge I gained from the foundation course is highly valuable and naturally cannot be shared. So it’s necessary to reflect and adjust the direction of future blog content.

### Follow-up Study Plan for Blockchain Technology

Here are the blockchain topics I still need to catch up on:

1. Study and research Bitcoin scripting
2. Learn to write and deploy smart contracts on popular chains like Solana, Aptos, and Sui
3. Study and research DeFi protocols like Uniswap and AAVE
4. Research and analyze the resumes and achievements of prominent figures in the web3 field, and use them as benchmarks to improve myself
