Events in 2024:

1. Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin spot ETF approval, Bitcoin reaching new highs.

2. Trump endorsing BTC, Musk endorsing DOGE.

3. Bitcoin narratives cooled down, inscriptions and runes were ignored, Layer 2 technologies failed to gain traction (Lightning Network, Taproot, RGB, RGB++), and no reliable Layer 2 projects emerged (Nervos, Merlin, Nubit, Fractal Bitcoin).

4. Ethereum's Cancun upgrade introduced Blob, significantly reducing Layer 2 costs. However, depositing from Layer 2 to exchanges still requires a 25-minute waiting period, which creates a poor user experience. Since reorganization is possible, transactions remain unsafe.

5. NFT markets disappeared, with Coinbase and Binance shutting down NFT trading platforms.

6. DEXX exchange was hacked, resulting in tens of millions of funds stolen from thousands of users. Both the exchange and users were of Chinese background, with many being beginners.

Predictions for 2025:

1. Bitcoin price will hit a new high of $140,000.

2. Bitcoin does not need OP_CAT.

3. Ethereumâ€™s dominance will remain unshakable; all ETH Killers will lack potential, including Solana, Ton, Tron, Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, Cosmos, and SUI.

4. The existing public chain landscape will remain unchanged, and no new high-market-cap Layer 1 blockchain will emerge.

5. New blockchains with integrated technology will appear, incorporating low-cost features as native functionalities, such as oracles, random numbers, on-chain governance, Subnet, WebAssembly, DID, etc. To boost their appeal, they will also ride the ZK and AI hype, only to discover that ZK has no real effect and has no actual connection to AI.

6. Cross-chain functionality will remain a rigid demand, but no decentralized solution will succeed in practice, now or in the future.

7. New blockchains will inevitably be EVM-compatible, and new projects will prioritize EVM support.

8. Ecosystem-oriented projects will continue to emerge, following the technical frameworks of specific blockchains to pursue their own goals. Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, Internet Computer, and Avalanche all provide such ecosystem environments.
