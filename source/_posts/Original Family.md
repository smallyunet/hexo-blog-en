The original family is like a rope, one end on the ground, the other tied to you

As you fly higher and higher, wanting to soar even more

The rope on you reminds you that your family is still on the ground

You can keep flying, but the rope is still on you, and they are still on the ground

You have no ability to take them flying, nor do you want to return to the ground


<br>

They imagine what your life on the ground would be like

They hope you’ll come back to the ground someday

They’ve already prepared a nest for you there

But you can’t go back

What you need is a castle in the sky

They can’t help, nor can they understand

Why is it enough to live on the ground

And why you insist on flying


<br>

You’ve seen the splendor of the sky and don’t want to go back

You just don’t want to


<br>

They think flying is easy for you, that it’s easy to settle down in the sky

They think if it’s so easy to settle on the ground, why can’t it be the same in the sky

But just flying already takes all your strength

Just not falling already takes all your strength

You don’t have the energy to take others with you

And you’re even more afraid of falling down with them

That’s a responsibility, and a huge pressure

They’re on the ground and really can’t help

They’ve never left the ground, so they can’t understand this kind of pressure
