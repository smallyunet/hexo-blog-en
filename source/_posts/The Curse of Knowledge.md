At the beginning, everyone is an empty container:

<img src="1.png" style="width:20%">

As experiences grow, new contents are added to the container:

<img src="2.png" style="width:20%">

And new contents continue to increase:

<img src="3.png" style="width:20%">

When two containers meet, they contain different contents:

<img src="4.png" style="width:40%">

The two containers will try to show the same side of the content, create connections, reach consensus on certain issues, and form closer relationships:

<img src="5.png" style="width:40%">

As each continues to grow, the proportion of the same side decreases from 1/2 to 1/3, weakening their connection:

<img src="6.png" style="width:40%">

When the proportion of the same content becomes 1/4, they no longer continue to have a connection:

<img src="7.png" style="width:40%">

At this time, a third container appears:

<img src="8.png" style="width:60%">

The leftmost and middle containers, with a common proportion of 2/4 = 1/2, establish a connection:

<img src="9.png" style="width:60%">

As time continues and content continues to grow, the middle node acquires some unique and special content. This unique content is key to distinguishing one container from another, commonly known as independent thinking ability:

<img src="10.png" style="width:70%">

This special part of the content not only is special itself but also influences the existing content, making the previous content more enriched and characterized by independent thinking:

<img src="11.png" style="width:70%">

Due to the interference of special content on previous content, the proportion of the same previous content has decreased, weakening the relationship between the leftmost container and the middle container:

<img src="12.png" style="width:70%">

Even to the point of having no connection:

<img src="13.png" style="width:70%">

The leftmost container has never obtained such special content:

<img src="14.png" style="width:70%">

Until one day, the rightmost node acquires some special content, only it is triangular:

<img src="15.png" style="width:70%">

The middle container and the right container cannot reach a consensus:

<img src="16.png" style="width:70%">

The content of the middle container does not stop growing. After having special content, the newly added content also becomes colorful:

<img src="17.png" style="width:70%">

The middle container no longer has connections with the left and right nodes and finds it difficult to establish connections again:

<img src="18.png" style="width:70%">

The middle container is left alone, just like in the beginning:

<img src="19.png" style="width:70%">

The content of the middle container continues to grow:

<img src="20.png" style="width:25%">

Together with other containers, each continues to accumulate content independently:

<img src="21.png" style="width:60%">

In various forms and colors:

<img src="22.png" style="width:40%;">
