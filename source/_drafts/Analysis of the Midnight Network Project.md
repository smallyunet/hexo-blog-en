[Midngiht Network](https://midnight.network/) announced its launch back in 2022 and has been in technical R&D since then. In June of this year, it [officially announced](https://midnight.network/blog/state-of-the-network-june-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com) the TGE plan for the NIGHT token. The NIGHT token [airdrop](https://www.midnight.gd/) is still in the claiming phase, so Midnight Network has been fairly active lately.

**Project Overview**

To summarize what Midnight Network is doing: according to the [whitepaper](https://midnight.network/whitepaper), after integrating ZK technology, Midngiht Network can provide privacy protection for on-chain data. On other public blockchains, when DApps interact with the chain, they inevitably expose all user data and interaction records. Midnight Network tries to solve this by allowing part of the on-chain data to remain confidential (Shielded) when users interact with the blockchain.

Given this description, we might be curious about two technical questions:

1. What is the project architecture of Midnight Network?
2. How does Midngiht Network use ZK technology to keep on-chain data confidential?

The whitepaper also mentions other concepts like DID, RWA, and voting—these are mostly buzzword-type application scenarios and not worth focusing on.

**Project Background**

Midnight Network appears to have very strong financial backing. There’s no public fundraising information, yet it has been under continuous development for years and even uses a name like [Midnight Foundation](https://midnight.foundation/); ordinary teams generally wouldn’t dare call themselves a foundation. Its technical strength also looks solid. For example, it created a programming language called [Compact](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/writing) as the smart contract language, designed specifically for expressing ZK circuits. There’s also a lot of already released [software](https://docs.midnight.network/relnotes/overview), including a locally runnable Proof server, a browser wallet, a VS Code extension, and more—basically an entire self-built ecosystem. This suggests Midnight Network has deep technical reserves.

Unfortunately, there’s no open-source core code in Midnight Network’s public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/midnight-ntwrk), so we can’t analyze the technical architecture from the code; we can only infer implementations based on the documentation. Keep in mind that docs aren’t always reliable: even if not a single line of code exists, the documentation can still look comprehensive. An internal server could be a single-node program while externally being claimed as a decentralized network—don’t take the presence of a public testnet RPC as proof of anything.

**Consensus and Block Production**

There’s no need to over-worry, though; many operational flows are already disclosed in the docs. First, Midnight borrows Cardano’s [stake pools](https://docs.midnight.network/validate/run-a-validator/). Midnight nodes track Cardano’s staking to determine which nodes have block production rights. This is a bit like a sidechain model, but Midnight does not rely entirely on Cardano; it calls this approach a partner chain.

For [block production](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/nodes-and-dapps/consensus), Midnight draws on the PolkDot network’s Substrate approach: a PoA consensus called [AURA](https://openethereum.github.io/Aura) handles block authorship, and the [GRANDPA](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-consensus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#finality-gadget-grandpa) mechanism finalizes blocks. PolkDot uses this hybrid design to suit sub-networks and parachains. As for why Midnight uses it, there isn’t a clear explanation. One guess is that it directly used Substrate’s code to reduce secondary development; another is compatibility with ZK services—perhaps even trying to place a proof server on validator nodes.

In any case, it’s clear that Midnight Network has hardcore engineering chops and has customized both block production and consensus.

**Privacy Protection**

Midnight Network’s theoretical basis for on-chain privacy protection is IOHK’s paper [Kachina](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/kachina-foundations-of-private-smart-contracts/). The paper is complex, but the simple idea is to use ZK circuits to describe a smart contract’s state transition function. Traditional smart contracts expose public code to change state; Kachina attempts to hide those code details with ZK. The paper includes many concrete designs. For instance, fully describing all state transitions in ZK is difficult, so it simplifies by only describing accesses to a state oracle.

So Midnight’s privacy capability can be understood as an [engineering](https://docs.midnight.network/academy/module-4) realization of Kachina: generate ZK proofs off-chain for contract operations, verify those proofs on-chain, and then update on-chain state. Of course this is quite complex, but Midnight seems to have built the whole stack—even if the code isn’t open-source.

**Privacy Applications**

Given Midngiht’s mature application of ZK, it built [Zswap](https://docs.midnight.network/learn/understanding-midnights-technology/zswap), a token swap pool with privacy. Roughly speaking, only ZK commitments are exposed on-chain—it doesn’t reveal which two tokens were swapped or the swap amount. It’s somewhat similar to Zcash’s effect, but arguably done better.

**Token Model**

Midnight’s token model is also complex, with two tokens: NIGHT and DUST, reflecting the network’s intricate node structure. NIGHT is issued on Cardano and is 1:1 pegged to Midnight via the partner chain approach. DUST is used to pay fees on Midnight. Holding NIGHT continuously generates DUST—similar to Tron’s “energy,” where holding Trx yields energy.

**Summary**

Midnight Network demonstrates strong technical prowess. Whether in custom block production and consensus mechanisms or in the engineering implementation of ZK, the difficulty is high and beyond the capabilities of most teams. Although its narrative doesn’t align with current hype and likely won’t go viral, if the technology is open-sourced, it would undoubtedly leave a bold mark.
